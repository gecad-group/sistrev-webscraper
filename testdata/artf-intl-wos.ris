AB  - In this paper we presented an approach for systems identification using artificial intelligence. To demonstrate its practical applicability, we tested it in the medical field in the interpretation of electrophoresis tests, but this application can be implemented in different areas of interest e.g. in business, management, advertising, etc. Extensive research has been performed exploiting the robust properties of genetic algorithms and demonstrating their capabilities across a large range of problems. We can use this application in many activities areas (medical, business, etc.) The resulting recommendations may constitute the basis of future work in the use of genetic algorithms in business area.

AB  - Due to the large number of deaths and car accidents caused by the driver's lack of attention, car manufacturers are trying to integrate ADAS systems with artificial intelligence and CV.
   One function that helps the driver is traffic sign recognition (TSR). This is a technology with which a vehicle is able to recognize road signs placed on the road, e.g. "speed limit" or "give way" or "stop" all this being possible with the help of computer vision and Convolutional Neural Networks. In this article we propose an implementation based on LeNet architecture for traffic sign recognition using CNN.
   We preferred the deep learning approach for this challenge as methods like shape based or color based share a common weakness in factors as light changes, scale change, rotation.
   The paper presents implementation of the network architecture based on LeNet5 using Keras and TensorFlow library, how we trained the CNN using the GTSRB dataset, and what results we obtained training and using the network for real time applications using only CPU power, with Intel i7 7700K. The experimental results showed a 95% accuracy in recognizing traffic signs.

TI  - Ethical demands for responsable journalism in the context of artificial inteligence
T2  - DAIMON-REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE FILOSOFIA
AB  - The irruption of the widespread use of artificial intelligence in the field of communication and specifically in journalism shows a chiaroscuro result that should be analyzed from a critical perspective. The paper takes a critical look at the revolution that the growing presence of artificial intelligence is causing in journalistic methods and results, affecting its guarantees of quality and excellence. The text argues that it is necessary to critically approach the current impact, as well as the potential, that this presents for professionals, organizations and society, and proposes to do so from the hermeneutic-critical method of applied ethics. The study is structured in two parts. The first part takes an approach to the irruption of artificial intelligence in the practice of journalism, explaining the recommendations offered by different bodies to guide the incorporation of artificial intelligence in the practice of communication, specifically in journalism. The second part identifies the main ethical risks, recommendations and ethical principles for dealing with them through ethical self-regulation.

CP  - 7th ASME/JSME Thermal Engineering Conference/Summer Heat Transfer Conference
AB  - The use of artificial intelligence methodologies in a variety of real-world applications has been around for some time. However, the application of such methodologies to thermal science and engineering is relatively new, but is receiving ever-increasing attention in the published literature since the mid 1990s. Such attention is due essentially to special requirements and needs of the field of thermal science and Engineering (TSE) in terms of its increasing complexity and the recognition that it is not feasible to approach many critical problems in this field by the use of traditional analysis. The purpose of the present brief review is to point out the recent advances in the artificial intelligence (AI) field and the successes of such methodologies to the current problems in thermal science and engineering. Some shortfalls and prospect for future applications will also be indicated.

TI  - Artificial Inteligence-Based Security Authentication: Applications in Wireless Multimedia Networks
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - Security provisioning has become a key issue in wireless multimedia networks due to their vital roles in supporting various services. Conventional security solutions have deficiencies in computing efficiency and addressing emerging security challenges. In addition, traditional upper-layer authentication ignores the protection of the physical layer, leading to severe privacy data leakage. In this paper, we envision a new deep learning (DL)-enabled security authentication scheme to overcome these issues, while implementing Blind Feature Learning (BFL) and Lightweight Physical Layer Authentication (LPLA). Specifically, an intelligent authentication method is developed by exploring neural networks at the data collection unit to learn the characteristics of data. Then we propose a holistic authentication scheme based on machine learning to identify malicious multimedia devices. Experimental analysis verifies that the proposed scheme can guarantee the privacy of wireless multimedia sensors and achieve lightweight authentication. Performance results indicate that artificial intelligence-enabled authentication scheme improves the overall security of multimedia networks.

TI  - HEURISTIC ALGORITHM FOR PET IMAGES' SEGMENTATION USING ARTIFICIAL INTELIGENCE TECHNIQUES
T2  - ANALES AFA
AB  - The overall quantity of nuclear medicine procedures has increased remarkably in recent years, making them a daily tool capable of reaching wide sectors of the population. Regarding the nuclear medicine therapeutic applications, it is worth noting that there is an increasing demand of novel techniques and greater variety of radioisotopes requiring accurate patient-specific dosimetry aimed at evaluating lethal damage to the tumor while maintaining acceptable dose levels in healthy tissues. Image-guided internal dosimetry appears as particularly suitable for theranostics procedures, which allow the joint implementation of diagnose and treatment. In this case, the correct segmentation of the images is critical for the identification of different tissues and organs. On the other hand, modern tools based on data science and artificial intelligence have spread in several fields, particularly in the digital image processing. The use of machine learning models for digital image processing appears as a promising opportunity to complement clinical analysis by experts. This paper reports about an unsupervised segmentation heuristic algorithm using clustering and machine learning techniques together, based on the use of two algorithms: K-Means and HDBSCAN. The results obtained highlight the capacity of automatic segmentation by means of clustering algorithms, becoming a useful tool to assist clinician experts and shorten the segmentation times.

T2  - HUMANIDADES & INOVACAO
AB  - This work conducts a study on the use of digital technologies in the education process, since we can no longer disassociate the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in the teaching-learning process, using artificial intelligence (AI). Considering that we are facing a pandemic, such as that of COVID-19, we must be prepared to participate in an active, targeted and efficient way, making the student have the best experience and learning possible. AI is an area of computer science that studies the phenomenon of intelligence and that through it instruments can be built to support human intelligence, through mechanisms or software. The use of AI in education has been significant, especially in distance education as it can be worked with interactions between the teacher and student and directly in the learning environment with games, quiz, and others.

TI  - Artificial Inteligence-Based Decision for the Prediction of Cardioembolism in Patients with Chagas Disease and Ischemic Stroke
T2  - JOURNAL OF STROKE & CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES
AB  - Background: Chagas disease (CD) and ischemic stroke (IS) have a close, but poorly understood, association. There is paucity of evidence on the ideal secondary prophylaxis and etiological determination, with few cardioembolic patients being identified. Aims: This study aimed to describe a multicenter cohort of patients with concomitant CD and IS admitted in tertiary centers and to create a predictive model for cardioembolic embolism in CD and IS. Materials and methods: We retrospectively studied data obtained from electronic medical and regular medical records of patients with CD and IS in several academic, hospital-based, and university hospitals across Brazil. Descriptive analyses of cardioembolic and non-cardioembolic patients were performed. A prediction model for cardioembolism was proposed with 70% of the sample as the derivation sample, and the model was validated in 30% of the sample. Results: A total of 499 patients were analyzed. The median age was similar in both groups; however, patients with cardioembolic embolism were younger and tended to have higher alcoholism, smoking, and death rates. The predictive model for the etiological classification showed close relation with the number of abnormalities detected on echocardiography and electrocardiography as well as with vascular risk factors. Conclusions: Our results replicate in part those previously published, with a higher prevalence of vascular risk factors and lower median age in patients with cardioembolic etiology. Our new model for predicting cardioembolic etiology can help identify patients with higher recurrence rate and therefore allow an optimized strategy for secondary prophylaxis.

AB  - Sex robots have emerged as a topic of growing ethical and social concern, especially in terms of their impact on the individuals' sexual health and their potential to establish loving relationships with users. The implementation of artificial emotional intelligence (AEI) into sex robots could increase the likelihood of users developing feelings of love towards these machines. This article explores whether the integration of AEI would exacerbate or offer a solution to the ethical issues surrounding sex robots, while also evaluating the impact of AEI on users' emotional and sexual wellbeing. It also proposes some practical guidelines for an ethical design of sex robots and emphasises the need for ongoing dialogue and research on the role of AEI technology in sex robots, seeking to contribute to the broader discussion on the ethical implications of such technological advancements.

TI  - Enhancing Legally-Based E-Government Services in Education Through Artificial Intelligence
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE RESEARCH IN SCIENCE ENGINEERING AND EDUCATION-IJCRSEE
AB  - Through the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI), governments can automate the analysis of publicly available government datasets. This process aids in the recognition of patterns and the development of a more profound comprehension of various socio-economic factors and empowers governments to base their policy decisions on data, effectively tackling societal issues, and optimizing the allocation of resources. In this paper we present AI's application in the realm of e-government, with particular emphasis on its potential influence on the advancement of this field through e-government services and their significance for a range of stakeholders. Moreover, we have conducted comprehensive review of existing literature on the subject and the identification of avenues for enhancement along with consideration of legislation as a potent instrument to guide the progression of AI within the sphere of e-government, thereby amplifying its transformative effect. We emphasize the importance of education in area of AI in order to ensure it's high quality implementation in this and other areas.

TI  - Artificial intelligence for classification of temporal lobe epilepsy with ROI-level MRI data: A worldwide ENIGMA-Epilepsy study
T2  - NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL
AB  - Artificial intelligence has recently gained popularity across different medical fields to aid in the detection of diseases based on pathology samples or medical imaging findings. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a key assessment tool for patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The role of machine learning and artificial intelligence to increase detection of brain abnormalities in TLE remains inconclusive. We used support vector machine (SV) and deep learning (DL) models based on region of interest (ROI-based) structural (n = 336) and diffusion (n = 863) brain MRI data from patients with TLE with ("lesional") and without ("non-lesional") radiographic features suggestive of underlying hippocampal sclerosis from the multinational (multi-center) ENIGMA-Epilepsy consortium. Our data showed that models to identify TLE performed better or similar (68-75%) compared to models to lateralize the side of TLE (56-73%, except structural-based) based on diffusion data with the opposite pattern seen for structural data (67-75% to diagnose vs. 83% to lateralize). In other aspects, structural and diffusion-based models showed similar classification accuracies. Our classification models for patients with hippocampal sclerosis were more accurate (68-76%) than models that stratified non-lesional patients (53-62%). Overall, SV and DL models performed similarly with several instances in which SV mildly outperformed DL. We discuss the relative performance of these models with ROI-level data and the implications for future applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence in epilepsy care.

T2  - 28TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON METALLURGY AND MATERIALS (METAL 2019)
CP  - 28th International Conference on Metallurgy and Materials (METAL)
AB  - This work summarizes results and progress in new method development for identification of material properties of steel. This work deals with application of the small punch test for evaluation of material degradation of power station in the Czech Republic within the project TE01020068 "Centre of research and experimental development of reliable energy production, work package 8: Research and development of new testing methods for evaluation of material properties". The main effort is here an improvement of empirical correlation of selected steel materials used in power industry for the manufacturing of critical components (rotors, steam-pipes, etc.). The effort here is on the utilization of the finite element method (FEM) and the neural network (NN) for evaluation of mechanical properties (Young modulus of elasticity, yield stress, tensile strength) of the selected material, based on SPT results only. Paper contains results of experimental work carried out over past 7 years. After modification of actual neural network and increasing of the number of results interesting results of mechanical properties prediction have been obtained. Increasing data of points in common up to 300, leads to significantly lower deviation that varies about 3-5 %.

TI  - DANNP: an efficient artificial neural network pruning tool
T2  - PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB  - Background. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a robust class of machine learning models and are a frequent choice for solving classification problems. However, determining the structure of the ANNs is not trivial as a large number of weights (connection links) may lead to overfitting the training data. Although several ANN pruning algorithms have been proposed for the simplification of ANNs, these algorithms are not able to efficiently cope with intricate ANN structures required for complex classification problems.
   Methods. We developed DANNP, a web-based tool, that implements parallelized versions of several ANN pruning algorithms. The DANNP tool uses a modified version of the Fast Compressed Neural Network software implemented in C++ to considerably enhance the running time of the ANN pruning algorithms we implemented. In addition to the performance evaluation of the pruned ANNs, we systematically compared the set of features that remained in the pruned ANN with those obtained by different state-of-the-art feature selection (FS) methods.
   Results. Although the ANN pruning algorithms are not entirely parallelizable, DANNP was able to speed up the ANN pruning up to eight times on a 32-core machine, compared to the serial implementations. To assess the impact of the ANN pruning by DANNP tool, we used 16 datasets from different domains. In eight out of the 16 datasets, DANNP significantly reduced the number of weights by 70%-99%, while maintaining a competitive or better model performance compared to the unpruned ANN. Finally, we used a naive Bayes classifier derived with the features selected as a byproduct of the ANN pruning and demonstrated that its accuracy is comparable to those obtained by the classifiers trained with the features selected by several state-of-the- art FS methods. The FS ranking methodology proposed in this study allows the users to identify the most discriminant features of the problem at hand. To the best of our knowledge, DANNP (publicly available at www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/dannp) is the only available and on-line accessible tool that provides multiple parallelized ANN pruning options. Datasets and DANNP code can be obtained at www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/dannp/data.php and https:// doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1001086.

TI  - Aritificial Inteligence Challenges in COPD management: a review
T2  - 2021 IEEE 21ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOINFORMATICS AND BIOENGINEERING (IEEE BIBE 2021)
CP  - 21st IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (IEEE BIBE)
AB  - Machine learning algorithms have been drawing attention in lung disease research. However, due to their algorithmic learning complexity and the variability of their architecture, there is an ongoing need to analyze their performance. This study reviews the input parameters and the performance of machine learning applied to diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). One research focus of this study was on clearly identifying problems and issues related to the implementation of machine learning in clinical studies. Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) protocol, 179, 1032, and 36,500 titles were identified from the PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases respectively. Studies that used machine learning to detect COPD and provided performance measures were included in our analysis. In the final analysis, 24 studies were included. The analysis of machine learning methods to detect COPD reveals the limited usage of the methods and the lack of standards that hinder the implementation of machine learning in clinical applications. The performance of machine learning for diagnosis of COPD was considered satisfactory for several studies; however, given the limitations indicated in our study, further studies are warranted to extend the potential use of machine learning to clinical settings.

TI  - Managing complexity: the EU's contribution to artificial intelligence governance
T2  - REVISTA CIDOB D AFERS INTERNATIONALS
AB  - With digital ecosystems being questioned around the world, this paper examines the EU's role in and contribution to the emerging concept of artificial intel-ligence (AI) governance. Seen by the EU as the key ingredient for innovation, the adop-tion of AI systems has altered our under-standing of governance. Framing AI as an autonomous digital technology embedded in social structures, this paper argues that EU citizens' trust in AI can be increased if the innovation it entails is grounded in a fun-damental rights-based approach. This is as-sessed based on the work of the High-Level Expert Group on AI (which has developed a framework for trustworthy AI) and the European Commission's recently approved proposal for an Artificial Intelligence Act (taking a risk-based approach).

TI  - EVALUATION OF PROSPECTS FOR APPLICATION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGY FOR BREAKING ROCKS BY A HYDROMONITOR WITH FINE PARTICLES IN ITS JET
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY-GEO ASSETS ENGINEERING
AB  - Relevance. Hydraulic monitors are widely used in the development of alluvial deposits in technological schemes with circulating water supply. Currently, deposits with more complex mining and geological conditions of occurrence are involved in mining. For placers, this is, first of all, a very significant content of clay in the host rocks and sands. When using the hydraulic method of field development, in particu-lar, during hydromonitor breaking of rocks, during circulating water supply, process water is taken from special settling ponds. However, due to the high content of clay in eroded rocks, fine particles of which have a very long period of settling in the water of the sump, this technology is experiencing significant difficulties. There are known solutions for the development of deposits in similar conditions with a controled content of fine soil particles in the pressurized water of the hydromonitor, where the calculation of the parameters of rock break-ing by the hydromonitor is proposed to carry out using the developed mathematical model. Further development of the proposed solutions is possible through the implementation of automation elements into the technological process, in particular, artificial neural networks.Purpose: to assess the prospects for using artificial intelligence technology for breaking rocks with a hydromonitor with fine particles in its jetMethods: implementation of artificial intelligence technologies based on artificial neural networks in the technological process of develop-ing aluvial deposits with clay content in host rocks and sands.Results. This article assesses the prospects for using artificial intelligence technology to control the breaking process using a multilayer feed-forward neural network.Conclusions. The proposed technology alows quickly managing the productivity of rock breaking with a hydraulic monitor, regulating power consumption, and improving as welthe quality of gravitational enrichment of a mineral by supplying water with an acceptable co n -tent of fine particles to the locks, which ultimately leads to reduction in the loss of the mineral and decrease in the cost of rock breaking with a hydromonitor and the entire technology as a whole, as welas to improvement of useful component recovery.

TI  - Feature Importance of Stabilised Rammed Earth Components Affecting the Compressive Strength Calculated with Explainable Artificial Intelligence Tools
T2  - MATERIALS
AB  - Cement-stabilized rammed earth (CSRE) is a sustainable construction material. The use of it allows for economizing on the cost of a structure. These two properties of CSRE are based on the fact that the soil used for the rammed mixture is usually dug close to the construction site, so it has random characteristics. That is the reason for the lack of widely accepted prescriptions for CSRE mixture, which could ascertain high enough compressive strength. Therefore, assessing which components of CSRE have the highest impact on its compressive strength becomes an important issue. There are three machine learning regression tools, i.e., artificial neural networks, decision tree, and random forest, used for predicting the compressive strength based on the relative content of CSRE composites (clay, silt, sand, gravel, cement, and water content). The database consisted of 434 samples of CSRE, which were prepared and crushed for testing purposes. Relatively low prediction errors of aforementioned models allowed for the use of explainable artificial intelligence tools (drop-out loss, mean squared error reduction, accumulated local effect) to rank the influence of the ingredients on the dependent variable-the compressive strength. Consistent results from all above-mentioned methods are discussed and compared to some statistical analysis of selected features. This innovative approach, helpful in designing the construction material is a solid base for reliable conclusions.

TI  - Evaluation of Scopio Labs X100 Full Field PBS: The first high-resolution full field viewing of peripheral blood specimens combined with artificial intelligence-based morphological analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LABORATORY HEMATOLOGY
AB  - Background Current digital cell imaging systems perform peripheral blood smear (PBS) analysis in limited regions of the PBS and require the support of manual microscopy without achieving full digital microscopy. We report a multicenter study that validated the Scopio Labs X100 Full Field PBS, a novel digital imaging system that utilizes a full field view approach for cell recognition and classification, in a decision support system mode. Methods We analyzed 335 normal and 310 abnormal PBS from patients with various clinical conditions and compared the performance of Scopio's Full Field PBS as the test method, with manual PBS analysis as the reference method. Deming regression analysis was utilized for comparisons of WBC and platelet estimates. Measurements of WBC and platelet estimation accuracy along with the agreement on RBC morphology evaluation were performed. Reproducibility and repeatability (R&R) of the system were also evaluated. Results Scopio's Full Field PBS WBC accuracy was evaluated with an efficiency of 96.29%, sensitivity of 87.86%, and specificity of 97.62%. The agreement between the test and reference method for RBC morphology reached 99.77%, and the accuracy for platelet estimation resulted in an efficiency of 94.89%, sensitivity of 90.00%, and specificity of 96.28%, with successful R&R tests. The system enabled a comprehensive review of full field PBS as shown in representative samples. Conclusions Scopio's Full Field PBS showed a high degree of correlation of all tested parameters with manual microscopy. The novel full field view of specimens facilitates the long-expected disengagement between the digital application and the manual microscope.

TI  - The Aspects of Running Artificial Intelligence in Emer-gency Care; a Scoping Review
T2  - ARCHIVES OF ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction: Artificial Inteligence (AI) application in emergency medicine is subject to ethical and legal inconsisten-cies. The purposes of this study were to map the extent of AI applications in emergency medicine, to identify ethical issues related to the use of AI, and to propose an ethical framework for its use. Methods: A comprehensive literature col-lection was compiled through electronic databases/internet search engines (PubMed, Web of Science Platform, MED-LINE, Scopus, Google Scholar/Academia, and ERIC) and reference lists. We considered studies published between 1 January 2014 and 6 October 2022. Articles that did not self-classify as studies of an AI intervention, those that were not relevant to Emergency Departments (EDs), and articles that did not report outcomes or evaluations were excluded. De-scriptive and thematic analyses of data extracted from the included articles were conducted. Results: A total of 137 out of the 2175 citations in the original database were eligible for full-text evaluation. Of these articles, 47 were included in the scoping review and considered for theme extraction. This review covers seven main areas of AI techniques in emer-gency medicine: Machine Learning (ML) Algorithms (10.64%), prehospital emergency management (12.76%), triage, patient acuity and disposition of patients (19.15%), disease and condition prediction (23.40%), emergency department management (17.03%), the future impact of AI on Emergency Medical Services (EMS) (8.51%), and ethical issues (8.51%). Conclusion: There has been a rapid increase in AI research in emergency medicine in recent years. Several studies have demonstrated the potential of AI in diverse contexts, particularly when improving patient outcomes through predic-tive modelling. According to the synthesis of studies in our review, AI-based decision-making lacks transparency. This feature makes AI decision-making opaque.

TI  - An Intelligent System for Video Surveillance in IoT Environments
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - Multimedia traffic has drastically grown in the last few years. In addition, some of the last paradigms proposed, like the Internet of Things (IoT), adds new types of traffic and applications. Software-defined networks (SDNs) improve the capability of network management. Combined with SDN, artificial intelligence (AI) can provide solutions to network problems based on classification and estimation techniques. In this paper, we propose an artificial intelligence system for detecting and correcting errors in multimedia transmission in a surveillance IoT environment connected through a SDN. The architecture, algorithm, and messages of the SDN are detailed. The AI system design is described, and the test-bed and the data set are explained. The AI module consists of two different parts. The first one is a classifying part, which detects the type of traffic that is sent through the network. The second part is an estimator that informs the SDN controller on which kind of action should be executed to guarantee the quality of service and quality of experience. Results show that with the actions performed by the network, like jitter can be reduced up to 70% of average and losses can be reduced from 9.07% to nearly 1.16%. Moreover, the presented AI module is able to detect critical traffic with 77% accuracy

TI  - Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats associated with the application of artificial intelligence in connection with sport research, coaching, and optimization of athletic performance: a brief SWOT analysis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SPORTS AND ACTIVE LIVING
AB  - Here, we performed a non-systematic analysis of the strength, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) associated with the application of artificial intelligence to sports research, coaching and optimization of athletic performance. The strength of AI with regards to applied sports research, coaching and athletic performance involve the automation of time-consuming tasks, processing and analysis of large amounts of data, and recognition of complex patterns and relationships. However, it is also essential to be aware of the weaknesses associated with the integration of AI into this field. For instance, it is imperative that the data employed to train the AI system be both diverse and complete, in addition to as unbiased as possible with respect to factors such as the gender, level of performance, and experience of an athlete. Other challenges include e.g., limited adaptability to novel situations and the cost and other resources required. Opportunities include the possibility to monitor athletes both long-term and in real-time, the potential discovery of novel indicators of performance, and prediction of risk for future injury. Leveraging these opportunities can transform athletic development and the practice of sports science in general. Threats include over-dependence on technology, less involvement of human expertise, risks with respect to data privacy, breaching of the integrity and manipulation of data, and resistance to adopting such new technology. Understanding and addressing these SWOT factors is essential for maximizing the benefits of AI while mitigating its risks, thereby paving the way for its successful integration into sport science research, coaching, and optimization of athletic performance.

TI  - Hepatitis B virus pathogenesis relevant immunosignals uncovering amino acids utilization related risk factors guide artificial intelligence-based precision medicine
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Background: Although immune microenvironment-related chemokines, extracellular matrix (ECM), and intrahepatic immune cells are reported to be highly involved in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related diseases, their roles in diagnosis, prognosis, and drug sensitivity evaluation remain unclear. Here, we aimed to study their clinical use to provide a basis for precision medicine in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via the amalgamation of artificial intelligence.Methods: High-throughput liver transcriptomes from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), NODE (), the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and our in-house hepatocellular carcinoma patients were collected in this study. Core immunosignals that participated in the entire diseases course of hepatitis B were explored using the "Gene set variation analysis " R package. Using ROC curve analysis, the impact of core immunosignals and amino acid utilization related gene on hepatocellular carcinoma patient's clinical outcome were calculated. The utility of core immunosignals as a classifier for hepatocellular carcinoma tumor tissue was evaluated using explainable machine-learning methods. A novel deep residual neural network model based on immunosignals was constructed for the long-term overall survival (LS) analysis. In vivo drug sensitivity was calculated by the "oncoPredict " R package.Results: We identified nine genes comprising chemokines and ECM related to hepatitis B virus-induced inflammation and fibrosis as CLST signals. Moreover, CLST was co-enriched with activated CD4+ T cells bearing harmful factors (aCD4) during all stages of hepatitis B virus pathogenesis, which was also verified by our hepatocellular carcinoma data. Unexpectedly, we found that hepatitis B virus-hepatocellular carcinoma patients in the CLST(high)aCD4(high) subgroup had the shortest overall survival (OS) and were characterized by a risk gene signature associated with amino acids utilization. Importantly, characteristic genes specific to CLST/aCD4 showed promising clinical relevance in identifying patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma via explainable machine learning. In addition, the 5-year long-term overall survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients can be effectively classified by CLST/aCD4 based GeneSet-ResNet model. Subgroups defined by CLST and aCD4 were significantly involved in the sensitivity of hepatitis B virus-hepatocellular carcinoma patients to chemotherapy treatments.Conclusion: CLST and aCD4 are hepatitis B virus pathogenesis-relevant immunosignals that are highly involved in hepatitis B virus-induced inflammation, fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Gene set variation analysis derived immunogenomic signatures enabled efficient diagnostic and prognostic model construction. The clinical application of CLST and aCD4 as indicators would be beneficial for the precision management of hepatocellular carcinoma.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - Modeling is essential for modern science, and science-based policies are directly affected by the reliability of model outputs. Artificial intelligence has improved the accuracy and capability of model simulations, but often at the expense of a rational understanding of the systems involved. The lack of transparency in black box models, artificial intelligence based ones among them, can potentially affect the trust in science driven policy making. Here, we suggest that a broader discussion is needed to address the implications of black box approaches on the reliability of scientific advice used for policy making. We argue that participatory methods can bridge the gap between increasingly complex scientific methods and the people affected by their interpretations

CP  - International Conference and Exposition on Electrical and Power Engineering (EPE)
AB  - Important changes that occurred during the last years regarding the shifting of the consumption share from high voltage (HV) to medium voltage (MV) and low voltage (LV), the diversification and the increase of the number of non-linear and/or non-symmetrical consumers, the removal of the reactive power sources (shunt capacitor banks - SCB) that contained polychlorinated biphenyl compounds (PBC) placed in the electricity repartition and distribution systems (ERDS), etc., led to the appearance of some complex problems related to the maintaining of the quality of electricity delivered to the consumers through ERDS. Using multi-criteria optimization processes, the paper presents mathematical models, algorithms and computation software intended for the best management of the reactive power sources, both in the nodes of the electricity repartition systems (ERS) and the electricity distribution systems (EDS). Thus, either traditional algorithms or algorithms based on possibilities offered by artificial intelligence are used.

TI  - INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES FOR FISH BREEDING WITH MINIMAL IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PAPERS-SERIES D-ANIMAL SCIENCE
AB  - This study refers to the common carp (Cyprinus carpio), which is an adaptable species that enriches the variability of quantitative and qualitative characteristics and increases genetic diversity. Local aquaculture populations of common carp, called "landraces," have developed due to different environmental conditions and breeding efforts. However, the introduction of carp in some areas has led to negative impacts on natural aquatic ecosystems. To improve the quality of economically important fish species, the variation in morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics is utilized. In this study, a patent application for a system for reproduction, selection, and growth of fish fry with the simulation of natural conditions is described. The article explains the method used to replicate the natural aquatic environment and create viable products with high genetic adaptability to its conditions. The process falls into the category of extensive aquaculture, promoting sustainable aquaculture by increasing the percentage of ecological and environmentally friendly productions. The study concludes with the results and the development of a set-up of the station for laboratory use.

The objective of this study was to analyze the difficulties and results from two different processes of document categorization in a restricted knowledge domain. The first one was based on the use of keywords and the second was based on the use of citations for document representation. To illustrate the use of different attributes in document representation, two experiments were conducted. The first one used a categorization algorithm based on keywords. The second experiment generated categories, using Artificial Neural Networks, from the citations of the articles. In the restricted knowledge domain, as used in this study, it was difficult to form groups that use keywords as attributes of the categorization process due to the great similarity of keywords used by the authors. The citations can be, as shown in the second experiment, an alternative and more efficient attribute for the categorization process of these documents. The formation of a set of articles with significant bibliographic coupling and a strong semantic relationship validated the method proposed. The article details the methodology used in the experiments, showing the importance of careful pre-processing phase for the reliability of the databases. This study may contribute to the research related to the representation of documents in categorization processes and information retrieval.

TI  - Omnidirectional Kick for a Humanoid Robot
T2  - 7TH IBERIAN CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGIES (CISTI 2012)
CP  - 7th Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies (CISTI)
AB  - In this paper we propose a method to develop an omnidirectional kick (behavior) for a humanoid robot. This behavior uses a path planning module to create a trajectory that the foot must follow to propel the ball in the intended direction. Two additional modules were required when performing the movement: Inverse kinematics module which computes the value of the joints to position the foot at a given position and the stability module which is responsible for the robot's stability. Simulation tests are performed under different ball positions, relative to the robot's orientation, and for various ball directions. The results obtained showed the usefulness of the approach since the behavior performs accurately the intended motion and is able to kick the ball in all the directions desired.

TI  - A Systematic Approach of Dataset definition for a Supervised Machine Learning using NFR Framework
T2  - 2018 11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE QUALITY OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY (QUATIC)
CP  - 11th International Conference on the Quality of Information and Communications Technology (QUATIC)
AB  - Non-functional requirements describe important constraints upon the software development and should therefore be considered and specified as early as possible during the system analysis. Effective elicitation of requirements is arguably among the most important of the resulting recommended RE practices. Recent research has shown that artificial intelligence techniques such as Machine Learning and Text Mining perform the automatic extraction and classification of quality attributes from text documents with relevant results. This paper aims to define a systematic process of dataset generation through NFR Framework catalogues improving the NFR's classification process using Machine Learning techniques. A well-known dataset (Promise) was used to evaluate the precision of our approach reaching interesting results. Regarding to security and performance we obtained a precision and recall ranging between similar to 85% and similar to 98%. And we achievement a F1 above similar to 79% when classified the security, performance and usability together.

TI  - INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES FOR FISH BREEDING WITH MINIMAL IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PAPERS-SERIES D-ANIMAL SCIENCE
AB  - This study refers to the common carp (Cyprinus carpio), which is an adaptable species that enriches the variability of quantitative and qualitative characteristics and increases genetic diversity. Local aquaculture populations of common carp, called "landraces," have developed due to different environmental conditions and breeding efforts. However, the introduction of carp in some areas has led to negative impacts on natural aquatic ecosystems. To improve the quality of economically important fish species, the variation in morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics is utilized. In this study, a patent application for a system for reproduction, selection, and growth of fish fry with the simulation of natural conditions is described. The article explains the method used to replicate the natural aquatic environment and create viable products with high genetic adaptability to its conditions. The process falls into the category of extensive aquaculture, promoting sustainable aquaculture by increasing the percentage of ecological and environmentally friendly productions. The study concludes with the results and the development of a set-up of the station for laboratory use.

TI  - Machine Learning Augmented Echocardiography for Diastolic Function Assessment
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE
AB  - Cardiac diastolic dysfunction is prevalent and is a diagnostic criterion for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction-a burgeoning global health issue. As gold-standard invasive haemodynamic assessment of diastolic function is not routinely performed, clinical guidelines advise using echocardiography measures to determine the grade of diastolic function. However, the current process has suboptimal accuracy, regular indeterminate classifications and is susceptible to confounding from comorbidities. Advances in artificial intelligence in recent years have created revolutionary ways to evaluate and integrate large quantities of cardiology data. Imaging is an area of particular strength for the sub-field of machine-learning, with evidence that trained algorithms can accurately discern cardiac structures, reliably estimate chamber volumes, and output systolic function metrics from echocardiographic images. In this review, we present the emerging field of machine-learning based echocardiographic diastolic function assessment. We summarise how machine-learning has made use of diastolic parameters to accurately differentiate pathology, to identify novel phenotypes within diastolic disease, and to grade diastolic function. Perspectives are given about how these innovations could be used to augment clinical practice, whilst areas for future investigation are identified.

AB  - This paper discusses If multi-agent learning is the answer what is the question? [Y. Shoham, R. Powers, T. Grenager, If multi-agent learning is the answer, what is the question? Artificial Intelligence 171 (7) (2007) 365-377, this issue] from the perspective of evolutionary game theory. We briefly discuss the concepts of evolutionary game theory, and examine the main conclusions from [Y. Shoham, R. Powers, T. Grenager, If multi-agent learning is the answer, what is the question? Artificial Intelligence 171 (7) (2007) 365-377, this issue] with respect to some of our previous work. Overall we find much to agree with, concluding, however, that the central concerns of multiagent learning are rather narrow compared with the broad variety of work identified in [Y. Shoham, R.

TI  - Fake News Detection on Social Media: A Temporal-Based Approach
T2  - CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB  - Following the development of communication techniques and smart devices, the era of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big data has arrived. The increased connectivity, referred to as hyper-connectivity, has led to the development of smart cities. People in these smart cities can access numerous online contents and are always connected. These developments, however, also lead to a lack of standardization and consistency in the propagation of information throughout communities due to the consumption of information through social media channels. Information cannot often be verified, which can confuse the users. The increasing influence of social media has thus led to the emergence and increasing prevalence of fake news. In this study, we propose a methodology to classify and identify fake news emanating from social channels. We collected content from Twitter to detect fake news and statistically verified that the temporal propagation pattern of quote retweets is effective for the classification of fake news. To verify this, we trained the temporal propagation pattern to a two-phases deep learning model based on convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory. The fake news classifier demonstrates the ability for its early detection. Moreover, it was verified that the temporal propagation pattern was the most influential feature compared to other feature groups discussed in this paper.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 13TH ACM MULTIMEDIA SYSTEMS CONFERENCE, MMSYS 2022
CP  - 13th ACM Multimedia Systems Conference (MMSys)
AB  - This paper contains the research proposal of Juan Antonio De Rus that was presented at the MMSys 2022 doctoral symposium. The use of virtual reality (VR) is growing every year. With the normalization of remote work it is to expect that the use of immersive virtual environments to support tasks as online meetings, education, etc, will grow even more. VR environments typically include multimodal content formats (synthetic content, video, audio, text) and even multi-sensory stimuli to provide an enriched user experience. In this context, Affective Computing (AC) techniques assisted by Artificial Intelligence (AI) become a powerful means to determine the user's perceived Quality of Experience (QoE). In the field of AC, we investigate a variety of tools to obtain accurate emotional analysis by using AI techniques applied on physiological data. In this doctoral study we have formulated a set of open research questions and objectives on which we plan to generate valuable contributions and knowledge in the field of AC, spatial audio, and multimodal interactive virtual environments, one of which is the creation of tools to automatically evaluate the QoE, even in real-time, which can provide valuable benefits both to service providers and consumers. For data acquisition we use sensors of different quality to study the scalability, reliability and replicability of our solutions, as clinical-grade sensors are not always within the reach of the average user.

AB  - Belief merging has received much attention from the research community with a large range of applications in Computer Science and Artificial Inteligence. In this paper, we represent a new belief merging approach for prioritized belief bases. The main idea of this method is to use two operators, namely connective strong operator and averagely increasing operator to merge possibilistic belief bases. By this way, the proposed method allows to keep more useful beliefs, which may be lost in other methods because of drowning effect. The logical properties of merging result are also analyzed and discussed.

TI  - Handwriting identification and verification using artificial intelligence-assisted textural features
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Intelligent process control and automation systems require verification authentication through digital or handwritten signatures. Digital copies of handwritten signatures have different pixel intensities and spatial variations due to the factors of the surface, writing object, etc. On the verge of this fluctuating drawback for control systems, this manuscript introduces a Spatial Variation-dependent Verification (SVV) scheme using textural features (TF). The handwritten and digital signatures are first verified for their pixel intensities for identification point detection. This identification point varies with the signature's pattern, region, and texture. The identified point is spatially mapped with the digital signature for verifying the textural feature matching. The textural features are extracted between two successive identification points to prevent cumulative false positives. A convolution neural network aids this process for layered analysis. The first layer is responsible for generating new identification points, and the second layer is responsible for selecting the maximum matching feature for varying intensity. This is non-recurrent for the different textures exhibited as the false factor cuts down the iterated verification. Therefore, the maximum matching features are used for verifying the signatures without high false positives. The proposed scheme's performance is verified using accuracy, precision, texture detection, false positives, and verification time.

A chatbot in the instant messaging service Telegram, with human lenguage tecnologies and artificial inteligence, has been implemented. The main obstacle has been to off er this chatbot in the two oficial languages of Comunidad Valenciana, so automatic translation has been used as a middleware component. This chatbot offers numerous advantages to UA for the enrollment process, however we emphasize it represents a reinforcement of the student service, in terms of human cost reduction and assistance 24/7. This technology generates a trusted environment between UA and its potential students.

T2  - MODELING AND USING CONTEXT, PROCEEDINGS
CP  - 3rd International Conference on the Topic of Context
AB  - This paper is devoted to discuss a general tendency in contextualism which is known as "radical contextualism". In the first part I state the well known paradox of semantic holism, as discussed in philosophy of language: if meaning is holistic there is no possibility to share any meaning. In the second part I present the different answers to this paradox, from atomism to different forms of holism. In the third part I give a criticism of the traditional interpretation of Wittgenstein as a supporter of global holism. I stress some similarities between Wittgenstein's thought and Multi Context theories in artificial inteligence. In the last part I give some argument against a rigid interpretation of "local holism": I claim the need to give restrictions to local holim and to develop a study of the connections between "default" properties and high level rules which are studied in Multi-Context theories.

TI  - Real time blast furnace modelling
T2  - METALURGIJA
AB  - The present blast furnace control systems are mainly based on black box principles. The great fu mace capacity and transport have an inconvenient influence on their efficiency. The white box approach requires the combination of measurement and mathematical modeling. This approach was used for the blast furnace No. 3 at VSZ Kosice and a mathematical model for process observation, process prediction and process simulation was developped, which gives a picture of the processes in the furnace. The model is based on continous real time inputs and gives forward information on blast furnace state and processes and enables the operator to check decision alternatives. In the models is applied analytical, empirical and artificial inteligence approaches. The principal structure of the control system is described.

TI  - Modeling Human Sensory-Motor Action for Vehicle Braking Based on Fuzzy Inferences
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2018 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRONICS, COMPUTERS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (ECAI)
CP  - 10th International Conference on Electronics, Computers and Artificial Intelligence (ECAI)
AB  - The mental modeling in terms of sensory-motor changes is one of the most challenging task in artificial inteligence and definitely is an important milestone for engineering and neurosciences. This paper starts from a reverse engineering perspective comparing functionality between real system the brain and target system the simulation model. At the conceptual level, we particularly analyse the three stages involved in mental functional mode of human action: sensory, perceptual, and representational (SPR). We proposed some structural models for basic functional modules and for the entire sensory-motor chain. The basic evidences that motivate us to consider fuzzy systems as suitable models for mental mechanisms in terms of sensory-motor changes are discussed. In this research we developed some minimal fuzzy inference systems simulating sensory, perception and representation blocks with specific fuzzified inputs. The three blocks connected into so called SPR structure is simulated in a certain scenario of human action and the results are analyzed from the perspective of human consistency. The proposed model is designed as a general case to study the action mode based on visual stimuli with common task to avoid the collision with an obstacle by controlling braking in car driving. The results show good agreement between simulated signals and human reactions in context.

TI  - Energy efficient indoor localisation for narrowband internet of things
T2  - CAAI TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGY
AB  - There are an increasing number of Narrow Band IoT devices being manufactured as the technology behind them develops quickly. The high co-channel interference and signal attenuation seen in edge Narrow Band IoT devices make it challenging to guarantee the service quality of these devices. To maximise the data rate fairness of Narrow Band IoT devices, a multi-dimensional indoor localisation model is devised, consisting of transmission power, data scheduling, and time slot scheduling, based on a network model that employs non-orthogonal multiple access via a relay. Based on this network model, the optimisation goal of Narrow Band IoT device data rate ratio fairness is first established by the authors, while taking into account the Narrow Band IoT network: The multi-dimensional indoor localisation optimisation model of equipment tends to minimize data rate, energy constraints and EH relay energy and data buffer constraints, data scheduling and time slot scheduling. As a result, each Narrow Band IoT device's data rate needs are met while the network's overall performance is optimised. We investigate the model's potential for convex optimisation and offer an algorithm for optimising the distribution of multiple resources using the KKT criterion. The current work primarily considers the NOMA Narrow Band IoT network under a single EH relay. However, the growth of Narrow Band IoT devices also leads to a rise in co-channel interference, which impacts NOMA's performance enhancement. Through simulation, the proposed approach is successfully shown. These improvements have boosted the network's energy efficiency by 44.1%, data rate proportional fairness by 11.9%, and spectrum efficiency by 55.4%.

CP  - International Conference on Management, Education and Social Science (ICMESS)
AB  - The history of rise and fall of ancient Chinese craftsmen is briefly reviewed, and it is point out that craftsmanship can't be developed isolated from the skill cultivate of craftsman. Based on an idea that applies artificial intelligence scientific technology to craftsmen skill modeling, steps and movements for vocational education are presented. To increase the efficiency of vocational skill cultivating we recommend that not only top craftsmen are engaged as guidance teachers, but also modern artificial intelligence engineers are involved in the understanding and representation of craftsman skills which can only be sensed and not explained historically. As a result, the process of high level vocational skill cultivating becomes more and more achievable.

TI  - Preventing Corrosion-Related Failures in Electronic Assembly: A Multicase Study Analysis
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPONENTS PACKAGING AND MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Corrosion is a prevalent failure mode in electronic products. The initiation of failure often stems from preexisting corrosion contamination on soldering terminations prior to assembly. This corrosion is further accelerated by environmental factors such as humidity, temperature, and acidity, ultimately leading to the degradation of the board and failure during both postassembly testing and the product's lifespan. This study presents a method for the real-time, early detection of corrosion contamination on electronic components during the mounting process using pick-and-place (PNP) technology. The method utilizes the correlation between light reflectance from soldering terminations during placement photography and the degree of corrosion present. Corroded terminations possess a rougher surface and pitting spots which result in different light reflectance compared to pristine terminations. This difference can be detected through artificial inteligence (AI) forensic analysis of component images. This study presents an AI model that correlates termination finish with corrosion content and progression, and evaluates its performance on large-scale data. This study also presents a real-world case where corroded components were identified during the PNP process, but later failed during in-circuit testing (ICT). The postfailure analysis, using scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) and cross-sectional analysis, confirms the accuracy of the AI failure predictions on multiple components with corrosion, during large-scale production. The proposed method has been implemented in multiple production lines, where it inspects all components without compromising throughput, and identifies contaminated components that are unsafe. The method has been tested on over 3.5 billion components and has achieved an accuracy rate of over 99.5% in its predictions.

TI  - DPNPED: Dynamic Perception Network for Polysemous Event Trigger Detection
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - Event detection is the process of analyzing event streams to detect the occurrences of events and categorize them. General methods for solving this problem are to identify and classify event triggers. Most previous works focused on improving the recognition and classification networks which neglected the representation of polysemous event triggers. Polysemy is habitually somewhat confusing in semantic understanding and hard to detect. To improve polysemous trigger detection, this paper proposes a novel framework called DPNPED, which dynamically adjusts the network depth between polysemous and common words. Firstly, to measure the polysemy, the difficulty factor is devised based on the frequency of a word as an event trigger. Secondly, the DPNPED utilizes a confidence measure to automatically adjust the network depth by comparing the predicted and initial probability distribution. Finally, our model applies focal loss to dynamically integrate the difficulty factor and confidence measure to enhance the learning of polysemous triggers. The experimental results show that our method achieves a noticeable improvement in polysemous event trigger detection.

TI  - Mappets: An Interactive Plugin for Transmedia Machinima on Unity3D

CP  - 12th IFIP International Conference on Entertainment Computing (ICEC)
AB  - The popularity of Machinima movies has increased greatly in the recent years. From a transmedia point of view, there was little development regarding tools to assist the production of Machinima. These are still mainly focused on the gaming community, and 3D animators. The developed tool aims to bring the typical workflow present on a normal movie set, into a machinima creation environment, expanding possibilities for transmedia productions. With Mappets as a plugin for the Unity3D game engine, we allow a translation from the typical movie dimension to a virtual one. This work evaluates the current state of art of machinima development tools and presents a working solution more adequate for transmedia productions and non-expert users interested in the production of machinima.

TI  - Real Time Facial Emotions Detection of Multiple Faces Using Deep Learning
T2  - PERVASIVE COMPUTING AND SOCIAL NETWORKING, ICPCSN 2022
CP  - 2nd International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Social Networking (ICPCSN)
AB  - Facial expression is a gesture developed with the facial muscles that communicates the individual's emotional expression. As Artificial Inteligence(AI) and Computer Vision technology advances, machines must learn to recognize human emotions in order to communicate effectively. Using the Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) technique, face expression are examined to detect emotion using deep learning. The proposed system is trained and evaluated in real time using the ADEES-BIV dataset. In the training phase, transfer learning technique is used to extract features from pictures as well as live video and a haar-cascade classifier is employed to detect the multiple faces in a frame. The Facial Action Coding System detects five universal emotions: happy, sad, neutral, surprise and anger and some micro emotions such as contempt, embarrass, fear, disgust and pride also can be detected by a person's face. It can recognize many facial emotions at the same time using deep learning. The system achieved a training accuracy of 81.67%.

TI  - A Constructive Heuristic for Police Patrol Routing Problems
T2  - PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Police patrol routing problem (PPRP) attracts researchers' attention especially on artifitial inteligence. The challenge here is that a limited number of patrols cover a wide range of area that includes several hotspots. In this study, a new model for PPRP is proposed simulating the Solomon's benchmark for vehicle routing problem with time windows. This model can solve this problem by maximising the coverage of hotspots with frequencies of high priority locations while ensuring the feasibility of routes. Two constructive greedy heuristics are developed to generate the initial solution of the PPRP: highest priority greedy heuristic (HPGH) and nearest neighbour greedy heuristic (NNGH). Experimental results show that the simulated Solomon's benchmark is suitable to represent PPRP. In addition, results illustrate that NNGH is more efficient to construct feasible solution than HPGH.

T2  - JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY RESEARCH
AB  - AimPrediction of labor progression is important for maternal and fetal health, as improved accuracy can lead to more timely intervention and improved outcomes. This review aims to outline the importance of predicting the progression of spontaneous parturition, detail the various methods employed to enhance this prediction and provide recommendations for future research.MethodsWe searched articles relating to labor progression and systematic review articles on Artificial Inteligence (AI) in childbirth management using PubMed. To supplement, Google Scholar was used to find recent guidelines and related documents.ResultsTraditional methods like vaginal examinations, criticized for subjectivity and inaccuracy, are gradually being replaced by ultrasound, considered a more objective and accurate approach. Further advancements have been observed with machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, which promise to surpass the accuracies of conventional methods. The Friedman curve, developed in 1954, is the standard for assessing labor progress, but its application to Asian women, in particular, remains controversial, and various studies have reported that the actual rate of labor was slower than that indicated by the Friedman curve.ConclusionThere is a need to innovate methodologies for predicting delivery tailored to modern pregnant women, especially when they have different genetic and cultural backgrounds than their Western counterparts, such as Asians. Future research should develop predictive models of labor progression that aim to enhance medical intervention and improve the safety and well-being of both mother and child.

CP  - 13th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology (ECTI-CON)
AB  - Coordinated design of the power system stabilizer (PSS) and static synchronous compensator controller parameters (STATCOM) using artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) to improve power system stability as an optimizations problem has been proposed in this study. ABC algorithm is a collective inteligence based on optimization algorithm inspired by the feeding behavior of bees in finding food. Rapid convergence and high precision are the capabilities of this algorithm which in this study to demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness, a two zone - four machines system is used and analyzed through non-linear simulation of time-domain and the results are compared with particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The optimization after a large turbulence shows that the coordinated design of the STATCOM and PSS controllers' parameters using the ABC algorithm considerably improves the system stability together with rapid damping of the system fluctuations as compared to the state without optimization. On the other hand, the optimization results using the ABC algorithm shows the superiority of this method over the PSO algorithm.

AB  - The field of expert system stil is one of the most dynamic in the domain of artificial inteligence. They are more and more used in manufacturing of mechanical parts, especialy those belonging to automotive, aerospace and military industries. Because an expert system is not something else than a computer program mening to replace the skills and experience of worker, in this paper is presented an scenario in ten group of scenes, in a general case, with the purpose to develop a such expert system. The ten group of scenes were called in the following manner: selecting the expert system team, selecting the problem, selecting the sources of good ideas, define the problem, knowledge acquisition process, formalizing the problem, selecting hardware and software tools, building a prototype, redefining problem, testing the expert system. Although the expert systems are very hard to please and expensive they are for much interest in the manufacturing area and a lot of specialist are concerned oneself with them and their going out from laboratory are indispensable.

TI  - Optimal Query Complexity Bounds for Finding Graphs
T2  - STOC'08: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2008 ACM INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON THEORY OF COMPUTING
CP  - 14th Annual ACM International Symposium on Theory of Computing
AB  - We consider the problem of finding an unknown graph by using two types of queries with an additive property. Given a graph, an additive query asks the number of edges in a set of vertices while a cross-additive query asks the number of edges crossing between two disjoint sets of vertices. The queries ask sum of weights for the weighted graphs. These types of queries were partially motivated in DNA shotgun sequencing and linkage discovery problem of artificial inteligence.
   For a given unknown weighted graph C with n vertices, m edges, and a. certain mild condition on weights, we prove that there exists a non-adaptive algorithm to find the edges in log n of G using O (m log n/log m) queries of both types provided that m > n(epsilon) for any constant epsilon > 0. For an unweighted graph, it is shown that the same bound holds for all range of m.
   This settles a conjecture of Grebinski [23] for finding an unweighted graph using additive queries. We also consider the problem of finding the Fourier coefficients of a certain class of pseudo-Boolean functions. A similar coin weighing problem is also considered.

AB  - Background: Despite a 2010 Kenyan constitutional amendment limiting members of elected public bodies to < two-thirds of the same gender, only 22 percent of the 12th Parliament members inaugurated in 2017 were women. Investigating gender bias in the media is a useful tool for understanding socio-cultural barriers to implementing legislation for gender equality. Natural language processing (NLP) methods, such as word embedding and sentiment analysis, can efficiently quantify media biases at a scope previously unavailable in the social sciences.Methods: We trained GloVe and word2vec word embeddings on text from 1998 to 2019 from Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper. We measured gender bias in these embeddings and used sentiment analysis to predict quantitative sentiment scores for sentences surrounding female leader names compared to male leader names.Results: Bias in leadership words for men and women measured from Daily Nation word embeddings corresponded to temporal trends in men and women's participation in political leadership (i.e., parliamentary seats) using GloVe (correlation 0.8936, p = 0.0067, r(2) = 0.799) and word2vec (correlation 0.844, p = 0.0169, r(2) = 0.712) algorithms. Women continue to be associated with domestic terms while men continue to be associated with influence terms, for both regular gender words and female and male political leaders' names. Male words (e.g., he, him, man) were mentioned 1.84 million more times than female words from 1998 to 2019. Sentiment analysis showed an increase in relative negative sentiment associated with female leaders (p = 0.0152) and an increase in positive sentiment associated with male leaders over time (p = 0.0216).Conclusion: Natural language processing is a powerful method for gaining insights into and quantifying trends in gender biases and sentiment in news media. We found evidence of improvement in gender equality but also a backlash from increased female representation in high-level governmental leadership.

TI  - Discrimination of fibroblast subtypes by multivariate analysis of gene expression
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER
AB  - Fibroblasts and myofibroblasts from normal, fibrotic or tumoral breast tissues present multiple quantitative differences in gene expression even when grown in isolation. We were therefore prompted to investigate whether one could recognize various subtypes by their constitutive-gene expression profile. Quantitative autoradiographic data for 34 constitutively expressed transcripts were submitted to multivariate analysis of variance, followed by discriminant analysis and single linkage cluster analysis. Models assuming up to 8 putative fibroblast subtypes (among fibroblasts or myofibroblasts from breast skin, normal mammary stroma, tumor-adjacent ''normal'' stroma, poet-radiation fibrosis lesions and benign or malignant tumors) and an epithelial-cell group used as an internal control resulted in 100% correct classification. Myofibroblasts from various origins clustered close to, although distinctly apart from, their corresponding alpha-smooth-muscle-actin-negative counterparts. Malignant tumor fibroblasts were phenotypically more distant from normal cells compared with other pathological types. Our results support the hypothesis of co-adaptive transformation of stromal and epithelial tissues during breast tumoral development and suggest that different types of fibroblasts give rise to different types of myofibroblasts. Discriminant analysis of quantitative molecular variation may be considered for the development of a powerful artificial-inteligence method for cell typing and should be particularly useful when no reliable discrete molecular markers are available.

TI  - Pre- and Post-processing Strategies for Generic Slice-wise Segmentation of Tomographic 3D Datasets Utilizing U-Net Deep Learning Models Trained for Specific Diagnostic Domains
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 15TH INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION, IMAGING AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS THEORY AND APPLICATIONS, VOL 5: VISAPP
CP  - 15th International Joint Conference on Computer Vision, Imaging and Computer Graphics Theory and Applications (VISIGRAPP) / 15th International Conference on Computer Vision Theory and Applications (VISAPP)
AB  - An automated and generally applicable method for segmentation is still in focus of medical image processing research. Since a few years artificial inteligence methods show promising results, especially with widely available scalable Deep Learning libraries. In this work, a five layer hybrid U-net is developed for slice-by-slice segmentation of liver data sets. Training data is taken from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon database, providing 131 fully segmented volumes. A slice-oriented segmentation model is implemented utilizing deep learning algorithms with adaptions for variable parenchyma shape along the stacking direction and similarities between adjacent slices. Both are transformed for coronal and sagittal views. The implementation is on a GPU rack with TensorFlow and Keras. For a quantitative measure of segmentation accuracy, standardized volume and surface metrics are used. Results DSC=97.59, JI=95.29 and NSD=99.37 show proper segmentation comparable to 3D U-Nets and other state of the art. The development of a 2D-slice oriented segmentation is justified by short training time and less complexity and therefore massively reduced memory consumption. This work manifests the high potential of AI methods for general use in medical segmentation as fully- or semi-automated tool supervised by the expert user.

TI  - Reconfiguration of distribution systems for voltage stability margin enhancement using tabu search
T2  - 2004 International Conference on Power System Technology - POWERCON, Vols 1 and 2
CP  - International Conference on Power System Technology (POWERCON 2004)
AB  - The reconfiguration of distribution systems is usually done to minimize real power losses, or to balance the load among feeders. Many reconfiguration methods based on heuristics, optimization, different kinds of artificial inteligence, and evolutive programming can be found in the literature. Similarly to transmission systems, distribution systems are also likely to experience voltage instability problems, especially during load peak hours in predominantly industrial areas. In this paper a reconfiguration algorithm based on tabu search for maximizing the security margin to voltage collapse (or loading margin) is proposed. Tabu search is a technique that consists basically of generating a number of appropriate possible configurations and choosing those that present desired characteristics as far as the objective to be attained is concerned. The evaluation of the different configurations is done with the help of voltage stability indices. In particular, an index that can be obtained with very small computational effort yet provides important information about the systems' stability condition was chosen. Simulation tests were conducted with small test to large realistic systems. The results have shown that the proposed method is very efficient and system configurations with the maximum loading margins and near-minimum real power losses are obtained. A comparison between adopting real power losses minimization and loading margin maximization is done. Moreover, a procedure for switching between those two objectives as a function of the total load daily curve is proposed.

TI  - AlphaFold Models of Small Proteins Rival the Accuracy of Solution NMR Structures
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR BIOSCIENCES
AB  - Recent advances in molecular modeling using deep learning have the potential to revolutionize the field of structural biology. In particular, AlphaFold has been observed to provide models of protein structures with accuracies rivaling medium-resolution X-ray crystal structures, and with excellent atomic coordinate matches to experimental protein NMR and cryo-electron microscopy structures. Here we assess the hypothesis that AlphaFold models of small, relatively rigid proteins have accuracies (based on comparison against experimental data) similar to experimental solution NMR structures. We selected six representative small proteins with structures determined by both NMR and X-ray crystallography, and modeled each of them using AlphaFold. Using several structure validation tools integrated under the Protein Structure Validation Software suite (PSVS), we then assessed how well these models fit to experimental NMR data, including NOESY peak lists (RPF-DP scores), comparisons between predicted rigidity and chemical shift data (ANSURR scores), and N-15-H-1 residual dipolar coupling data (RDC Q factors) analyzed by software tools integrated in the PSVS suite. Remarkably, the fits to NMR data for the protein structure models predicted with AlphaFold are generally similar, or better, than for the corresponding experimental NMR or X-ray crystal structures. Similar conclusions were reached in comparing AlphaFold2 predictions and NMR structures for three targets from the Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP). These results contradict the widely held misperception that AlphaFold cannot accurately model solution NMR structures. They also document the value of PSVS for model vs. data assessment of protein NMR structures, and the potential for using AlphaFold models for guiding analysis of experimental NMR data and more generally in structural biology.

TI  - Natural Language Processing Model Compiling Natural Language into Byte Code
T2  - 2017 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SPEECH TECHNOLOGY AND HUMAN-COMPUTER DIALOGUE (SPED)
CP  - International Conference on Speech Technology and Human-Computer Dialogue (SpeD)
AB  - The need of progress implies the need of time. Daily tasks have been automated to solve time issues but they still need the input of a user. The need for interaction with different applications may endanger the user's life. The simplest way for these automatiz ations to be "life-saving" is to fully support speech recognition. Although, right now, this is done in an acceptable manner, the main problem resides in the language processing model itself. Without a good language processing model, there is no "learning" and no "progress". This document is a technical proposal of a different approach regarding the processing of human languages and compiling it in a computer understandable form - byte code. The paper will treat the requirements needed for this to happen in the programming language known as Java, but the principles should be the same for any or all programming languages.

TI  - Lessons learned from the impact of COVID-19 on the global construction industry
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Purpose The construction industry represents most of every country's finances and vital to continued economic growth and activities, especially in developing countries. The impact of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 disease (COVID19) on the government's income resulted in the expectation of many public projects being cancelled or delayed providing little opportunity for the emergence of new public projects. This study collated a global qualitative perspective (survey interviews) on the lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic and the positive and negative impacts for future-proofing the construction sector. Design/methodology/approach In total, 76 respondents from five continents excluding South America responded to the online open-ended structured questionnaire. Data collected were analysed through artificial inteligence analytics tool - Zoho analytics. Findings The themes indicating the positive impact obtained from the interview were overhead cost reduction, remote working environment, focus on health and safety, improved productivity and sustainability goals while the themes signifying the negative impact were low business turnover, delays in construction payment and output, difficulties working from home and job losses. Supply chain management, construction project management improvement, concentration on health and safety and effective virtual working environment were collated as themes on lessons learned. Social implications The major findings of this study emphasise on the need to improve the occupational health and safety and onsite safety measures for future proofing of the construction industry. Originality/value The findings from the analyses made clear the imperativeness of the built environment research, with a focus on novel framework and strategies for future proofing the construction industry.

TI  - Machine Learning for Diagnosis of AD and Prediction of MCI Progression From Brain MRI Using Brain Anatomical Analysis Using Diffeomorphic Deformation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - Background: With the growing momentum for the adoption of machine learning (ML) in medical field, it is likely that reliance on ML for imaging will become routine over the next few years. We have developed a software named BAAD, which uses ML algorithms for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and prediction of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) progression.
   Methods: We constructed an algorithm by combining a support vector machine (SVM) to classify and a voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to reduce concerned variables. We grouped progressive MCI and AD as an AD spectrum and trained SVM according to this classification. We randomly selected half from the total 1,314 subjects of AD neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) from North America for SVM training, and the remaining half were used for validation to fine-tune the model hyperparameters. We created two types of SVMs, one based solely on the brain structure (SVMst), and the other based on both the brain structure and Mini-Mental State Examination score (SVMcog). We compared the model performance with two expert neuroradiologists, and further evaluated it in test datasets involving 519, 592, 69, and 128 subjects from the Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle Flagship Study of Aging (AIBL), Japanese ADNI, the Minimal Interval Resonance Imaging in AD (MIDIAD) and the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS), respectively.
   Results: BAAD's SVMs outperformed radiologists for AD diagnosis in a structural magnetic resonance imaging review. The accuracy of the two radiologists was 57.5 and 70.0%, respectively, whereas, that of the SVMst was 90.5%. The diagnostic accuracy of the SVMst and SVMcog in the test datasets ranged from 88.0 to 97.1% and 92.5 to 100%, respectively. The prediction accuracy for MCI progression was 83.0% in SVMst and 85.0% in SVMcog. In the AD spectrum classified by SVMst, 87.1% of the subjects were A beta positive according to an AV-45 positron emission tomography. Similarly, among MCI patients classified for the AD spectrum, 89.5% of the subjects progressed to AD.
   Conclusion: Our ML has shown high performance in AD diagnosis and prediction of MCI progression. It outperformed expert radiologists, and is expected to provide support in clinical practice.

AB  - We are focused on a new fast and robust algorithm of image/signal feature extraction in the form of representative keypoints. We analyze various multi-scale representations of a one-dimensional signal in spaces with a closeness relation determined by a symmetric and positive semi-definite kernel. We show that kernels arising from generating functions of fuzzy partitions can be used in a scale space representation of a one-dimensional signal. We show that the reconstruction from the proposed multi-scale representations is of better quality than the reconstruction from MLP with almost double the number of neurons in 4 hidden layers. Finally, we propose a new algorithm of keypoints localization and description and test it on financial time series with high volatility.

TI  - Detection of potential drug-drug interactions for risk of acute kidney injury: a population-based case-control study using interpretable machine-learning models
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI), with an increase in serum creatinine, is a common adverse drug event. Although various clinical studies have investigated whether a combination of two nephrotoxic drugs has an increased risk of AKI using traditional statistical models such as multivariable logistic regression (MLR), the evaluation metrics have not been evaluated despite the fact that traditional statistical models may over-fit the data. The aim of the present study was to detect drug-drug interactions with an increased risk of AKI by interpreting machine-learning models to avoid overfitting.Methods: We developed six machine-learning models trained using electronic medical records: MLR, logistic least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LLR), random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGB) tree, and two support vector machine models (kernel = linear function and radial basis function). In order to detect drug-drug interactions, the XGB and LLR models that showed good predictive performance were interpreted by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI), respectively.Results: Among approximately 2.5 million patients, 65,667 patients were extracted from the electronic medical records, and assigned to case (N = 5,319) and control (N = 60,348) groups. In the XGB model, a combination of loop diuretic and histamine H-2 blocker [mean (|SHAP|) = 0.011] was identified as a relatively important risk factor for AKI. The combination of loop diuretic and H-2 blocker showed a significant synergistic interaction on an additive scale (RERI 1.289, 95% confidence interval 0.226-5.591) also in the LLR model.Conclusion: The present population-based case-control study using interpretable machine-learning models suggested that although the relative importance of the individual and combined effects of loop diuretics and H-2 blockers is lower than that of well-known risk factors such as older age and sex, concomitant use of a loop diuretic and histamine H-2 blocker is associated with increased risk of AKI.

T2  - NDT: 2009 FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NETWORKED DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES
CP  - 1st International Conference on Networked Digital Technologies (NDT 2009)
AB  - In this paper we compare two new neural networks methods, aimed at solving the problem of optimal binary matrix Boolean factorization or Boolean factor analysis. Neural network based Boolean factor analysis is a suitable method for a very large binary data sets mining including web. Two types of neural networks based Boolean factor analyzers are analyzed. One based on feed forward neural network and second based on Hopfield-like recurrent neural network. We show that both methods give good results when processed data have a simple structure. But as the complexity of data structure grows, method based on feed forward neural network loses the ability to solve the Boolean factor analysis. In the method, based on the Hopfield like recurrent neural network, this effect is not observed.

TI  - Formal analysis of Peterson's rules for checking validity of syllogisms with intermediate quantifiers
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING
AB  - In this paper, we follow up on previous publications in which we studied generalized Peterson's syllogisms with intermediate quantifiers. We present results of two kinds. First we show that on semantic level all the valid syllogisms follow from two inequalities and one equality. Furthermore, we focus on six rules suggested by Peterson in his book using which he was able to verify validity of all syllogisms. The problem is that the rules are formulated in free natural language and so, they do not provide formal means using which it would be possible to explain why the rules do their job. Therefore, we suggested formal reformulation of them and showed that all the valid syllogisms with intermediate quantifiers indeed satisfy Peterson's rules. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - We compare the performance accuracy of a slot-based antenna and a Vivaldi antenna for breast tumor detection using machine learning (ML) algorithms jointly with microwave imaging (MWI) processing. MWI is known for having low resolution. Therefore, we here study the conjoint use of ML and MWI, in order to enable accurate detection of breast tumors and evaluate how the probing antenna affects the overall system performance. To this end, we perform measurements in the frequency range of 2-6 GHz on anthropomorphic breasts of different volumes and shapes, where we placed two types of tumors. The slot-based antenna provides better imaging results (i.e. good detection of the tumor), but the accuracy of ML techniques is only 60%. Concerning the Vivaldi antenna, the images present clutter, but the accuracy of ML techniques is as high as 85%. These results show that ML and MWI can be complementary to each other.

TI  - Fading Channel Prediction for 5G and 6G Mobile Communication Systems
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Nowadays, there is a trend to employ adaptive solutions in mobile communication. The adaptive transmission systems seem to answer the need for highly reliable communication that serves high data rates. For efficient adaptive transmission, the future Channel State Information (CSI) has to be known. The various prediction methods can be applied to estimate the future CSI. However, each method has its bottlenecks. The task is even more challenging while considering the future 5G/6G communi-cation where the employment of sub-6 GHz and millimetre waves (mmWaves) in narrow-band, wide-band and ultra-wide-band transmission is considered. Thus, author describes the differences between sub-6 GHz/mmWave and narrow-band/wide-band/ultra-wide-band channel prediction, provide a comprehensive overview of available prediction methods, discuss its performance and analyse the opportunity to use them in sub-6 GHz and mmWave systems. We select Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) as the most promising technique for future CSI prediction and propose optimising two of its parameters - the number of input features, which was not yet considered as an opportunity to improve the performance of CSI prediction, and the number of hidden layers.

TI  - The theory of intermediate quantifiers in fuzzy natural logic revisited and the model of "Many"
T2  - FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS
AB  - The fuzzy natural logic (FNL) is a formal theory whose goal is to provide a mathematical model of natural human reasoning whose typical feature is the use of natural language. One of its tasks is to develop a mathematical model of a special class of linguistic quantifiers called intermediate ones. In our previous papers, we introduced a general principle of how intermediate quantifiers can be formed and suggested generalized definitions of the relations of contrary, contradictory, subcontrary, and subalterns between these quantifiers. Based on these relations and following Peterson's book [62], we were able to suggest a formal model of the 5-square of opposition with intermediate quantifiers. This paper picks up the threads of this work and has the following goals: it contributes to the development of the theory of fuzzy natural logic. First, it gets back to some concepts of the theory of evaluative linguistic expressions, introduces slight modifications, and proves some not yet presented properties. Furthermore, it improves the formal theory of intermediate quantifiers; some definitions are made more precise, and some new theorems are proved. Finally, it contributes to the theory of the intermediate quantifier "Many" and the analysis of its position in the mentioned 5-square. We will show that "Many" manifests an ambiguous relation towards the other quantifiers. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Granular Computing (GrC) emerges as a new multidisciplinary study and has received much attention in recent years. It is argued that GrC is more about the theoretical studies and a practical methodology of problem solving. By effectively using levels of granularity, GrC theory provides systematic practical way to analyze and represent the real world information. The most complicated problems are the image processing, analyze etc. Follow to very common terminology introduced by L. Zadeh we can notify the full collection of related problems in computer vision as "visual perception". There are three main fulcrum to provide the effective techniques for GrC algorithms. At first, we will use the General system theory to represent and circumscribe the image models. Second, we must use the Soft Computing guide principle to achieve the computational complexity reduction. At least, we must take into consideration all uncertainty factors (clutter), presented in real world images. Like the rock-climber, we can bear on the mentioned hand-holds and achieve the methodology for mathematically homogeneous process of visual perception.

T2  - 2022 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS (AICAS 2022): INTELLIGENT TECHNOLOGY IN THE POST-PANDEMIC ERA
CP  - IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Circuits and Systems (AICAS) - Intelligent Technology in the Post-Pandemic Era
AB  - A sparsity-aware 3D convolution neural network (CNN) accelerator is proposed for the real-time mobile hand gesture recognition (HGR) system. The complex computation of 3D convolution with the video data makes it difficult for real-time operation, especially in the resource-constrained mobile platform. To facilitate real-time implementation of HGR, this paper proposes two key features: 1) the inter-frame differential aware input method and IDANet to reduce the MAC operation and the external bandwidth by 84% and 95.2%, respectively, and achieve 79.97% accuracy on NvGesture dataset; 2) a low-latency 3D-CNN accelerator that utilizes activation and weight sparsity, achieving 31x faster inference latency than the state-of-the-art. The proposed processor is designed in 65 nm CMOS technology. It consumes 262 mW of power and achieves 599 GOPS/W of energy efficiency. As a result, the system realized 1.584 ms inference latency for real-time HGR in a mobile platform.

TI  - An efficient method for node ranking in complex networks by hybrid neighbourhood coreness
T2  - COMPUTING
AB  - Contagion spread is a common phenomenon observable on a variety of complex networks. The knowledge of key spreaders and contagion dynamics facilitates the design of applications that can either reduce the spread of unwanted contagion or amplify the proliferation of desired ones. Hence, it is essential to identify and rank the influential (key) spreaders in complex networks. Extended neighbourhood coreness (Cnc+) is one such method that uses the k-shell index to identify and rank the influential spreaders. The neighborhood of a node plays a very important role in contagion spread and the combination of local and global topological information of a node can better capture the spreading influence of the nodes. In this paper, a measure, namely, hybrid Cnc+ coreNess (HCN) is proposed that extends Cnc+ by including first and second order neighbourhood of a node (local information) along with the k-shell index. In experiments, HCN is compared with state of the art methods for both real and artificial datasets. The results show that HCN is accurate and better than state of the art methods. Further, least variation in ranking accuracy is observed in experiments of parameter variation for artificial networks. Computational complexity analysis shows that the proposed method achieves high accuracy incurring a small computational penalty.

T2  - HYBRID ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS
CP  - 3rd International Workshop on Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Systems
AB  - A Hybrid Intelligent System (HIS) for self-localization working on the readings of innovative 3D cameras is presented in this paper. The system includes a preprocessing step for cleaning the 3D camera readings. The HIS consist of two main modules. First the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is used to provide models of the preprocessed 3D readings of the camera. The 2D grid of the SOM units is assumed as a surface modeling the 3D data obtained from each snapshot of the 3D camera. The second module is an Evolution Strategy, which is used to perform the estimation of the motion of the robot between frames. The fitness function of the Evolution Strategy (ES) is given by the distance computed as the matching of the SOM unit grids.

TI  - Alternative OVA Proposals for Cooperative Competitive RBFN Design in Classification Tasks
T2  - ADVANCES IN COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, PT I
CP  - 12th International Work-Conference on Artificial Neural Networks (IWANN)
AB  - In the Machine Learning field when the multi-class classification problem is addressed, one possibility is to transform the data set in binary data sets using techniques such as One-Versus-All. One classifier must be trained for each binary data set and their outputs combined in order to obtain the final predicted class. The determination of the strategy used to combine the output of the binary classifiers is an interesting research area.
   In this paper different OVA strategies are developed and tested using as base classifier a cooperative-competitive RBFN design algorithm, (CORBFN)-R-2. One advantage of the obtained models is that they obtain as output for a given class a continuous value proportional to its level of confidence. Concretely three OVA strategies have been tested: the classical one, one based on the difference among outputs and another one based in a voting scheme, that has obtained the best results.

TI  - ADAPTIVE SHORT-TERM FORECASTING OF ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION BY AUTONOMOUS POWER SYSTEMS OF SMALL NORTHERN SETTLEMENTS BASED ON RETROSPECTIVE REGRESSION ANALYSIS METHODS
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY-GEO ASSETS ENGINEERING
AB  - The relevance. Construction of a problem-oriented tool for forecasting electricity consumption in smalnorthern settlements is of para -mount importance for the implementation of development plans for Arctic and Far North regions. At present, a large number of electricity consumption forecasting methods are used, including expert, statistical, artificial inteligence methods, hybrid methods, and others. As a rule, there is no universal method, equally effective (by the criterion & DLANGBRAC;counting time - counting accuracy & drangbrac;) for the main types of problems of electricity consumption forecasting. The noted circumstance requires research in the direction of creating a computational complex: identi-fication of computational properties of electricity consumption model - construction of an adequate method of information extraction. The purpose: development of an approach based on a retrospective regression analysis, which allows making adaptive short-term fore-casting of electricity consumption of regional isolated electrical complexes. Methods. The approach to obtain short-term forecasts of electricity consumption of regional isolated electrical complexes is based on a retrospective regression analysis. The predictive model based on the feedback from regionally isolated electrical complexes responses is presented in the form of a linear regression with an internal set of functions forming an orthogonal and orthonormalized basis. At the same time the preliminary information received from the object - feedback from regionaly isolated electrical complexes, is written in the form of a system of linear algebraic equations presented in matrix form. Finding of coefficients at basis functions is carried out taking into account the method of least squares, and the solution of the received equations - on the basis of Kaczmarz method. Verification of performance of the developed approach was carried out by means of the analysis of regression residuals of forecasting Results. With the help of adaptive short-term forecasting of electric power consumption by autonomous power systems of small northern settlements based on the methods of retrospective regression analysis the short-term forecast for the prediction interval of 30 minutes was obtained. Conclusions. An approach is proposed to consider short-term forecasting of electricity consumption by autonomous energy systems in smalnorthern settlements based on regression analysis methods. The paper demonstrates significant advantage of the developed ap-proach related to the fact that when building a procedure for adaptive short-term prediction of energy consumption based on retrospective regression analysis the rationalization combination of identifying coefficients at basis functions and rebuilding the mathematical model of a non-stationary discrete stochastic process at each step occurs. The analysis of regression residuals of feedback from regionally isolated electrical complexes forecasting was carried out and the performance of the developed algorithm of electricity forecasting and the adequa-cy of the accepted provisions in forming a priori information when implementing the approach to short-term forecasting of a stochastic pro-cess based on retrospective regression analysis was confirmed.

T2  - 2022 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION (ICRA 2022)
CP  - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)
AB  - We address the problem of devising the means for a robot to rapidly and safely learn insertion skills with just a few human interventions and without hand-crafted rewards or demonstrations. Our InsertionNet version 2.0 provides an improved technique to robustly cope with a wide range of use-cases featuring different shapes, colors, initial poses, etc. In particular, we present a regression-based method based on multimodal input from stereo perception and force, augmented with contrastive learning for the efficient learning of valuable features. In addition, we introduce a one-shot learning technique for insertion, which relies on a relation network scheme to better exploit the collected data and to support multi-step insertion tasks. Our method improves on the results obtained with the original InsertionNet, achieving an almost perfect score (above 97.5% on 200 trials) in 16 real-life insertion tasks while minimizing the execution time and contact during insertion. We further demonstrate our method's ability to tackle a real-life 3-step insertion task and perfectly solve an unseen insertion task without learning.

T2  - ANTICIPATORY BEHAVIOR IN ADAPTIVE LEARNING SYSTEMS: FROM BRAINS TO INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL BEHAVIOR
CP  - 3rd Workshop on Anticipatory Behavior in Adaptive Learning Systems held at the 9th International Conference on Simulation of Adaptive Behavior
AB  - Competitive distributed systems pose a challenge to trust modeling due to the dynamic nature of these systems (e.g. electronic auctions) and the unreliability of self-interested agents. We propose a trust model which does not assume a concrete cognitive model for other agents that an agent may interact with, but uses the discrepancy between the information provided by other agents and its own experience in order to anticipate their actions. By anticipating the behavior of other agents, an agent is able to adapt more effectively to changes in the environment for its own benefit.

T2  - INES'97 : 1997 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT ENGINEERING SYSTEMS, PROCEEDINGS
CP  - 1997 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Engineering Systems (INES 97)
AB  - Japanese industrial research and applications in the field of softcomputing that covers fuzzy, neuro and chaos have been surveyed. In the middle of 1980's in Japan the fuzzy technology became a central issue for mainly process control and the year 1990 became a so called ''fuzzy-home-electronics year.'' These technologies are mainly based on if-then rule based fuzzy inference with instrumentation (i.e., sensor and actuator) engineering. Then the neural network technology was merged in fuzzy technology in 1991 and again many consumer products were sent to the real market in Japan. Such neuro-fuzzy technologies are classified into 9 categories. In 1993 chaos technologies were also taken part in research and development of such high-tech issues. Very recently other technologies such as chaos, genetic algorithms and artificial life are also investigated by company engineers in Japan. These kinds of practical, technological aspects in Japan are discussed and the future trends are also indicated by giving many examples.

TI  - Blockchain-Based Data Collection With Efficient Anomaly Detection for Estimating Battery State-of-Health
T2  - IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL
AB  - The number of electric vehicles in various countries has shown exponential growth so that the related industries to face the tremendous pressure of power batteries disposal. Efficient secondary use and recycling of power batteries require effective collection of battery data and reasonable estimation of battery state-of-health (SOH). In this paper, we propose a framework to collect battery charging data from different stakeholders with an anomaly detection method based on Isolation Forest with two features. Besides a score-based mechanism is adopted to do data screening and capture the data with good quality. Unlike prior works, our proposed method can exploit crowdsourced data to reduce the significant effort of battery data sensing and provide a data source scoring mechanism based on blockchain to improve the data quality and meet the requirement of reasonable estimation. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed collection method, a charge data test set is constructed based on the NASA battery data set. The simulation results indicate that the method increases the F-measure criteria up to 25.65% compared to the well-known anomaly detection algorithms. In addition, the proposed collection method outperforms the traditional method up to 10.9% in reducing the relative error when being used for SOH estimation.

TI  - Inexact higher-order proximal algorithms for tensor factorization
T2  - 2023 IEEE STATISTICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING WORKSHOP, SSP
CP  - 22nd IEEE Statistical Signal Processing Workshop (SSP)
AB  - This paper explores Higher-order Methods (HoM) for Matrix Factorization (MF) and Tensor Factorization (TF) models, which are powerful tools for high dimensional data analysis and feature extraction. Unlike First-order Methods (FoM), which use gradients, HoM use higher-order derivatives of the objective function, which makes them faster but more costly per iteration. We develop efficient and implementable higher-order proximal point methods within the BLUM framework for largescale problems. We introduce the appropriate objective functions, the algorithm, and the experimental results that demonstrate the advantages of our HoM-based algorithms over FoM-based algorithms for MF and TF models. We show that our HoM-based algorithms have a lower number of iterations with respect to their per-iteration cost than FoM-based algorithms.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ELEVENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION (LREC 2018)
CP  - 11th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC)
AB  - Summarization of multi-party conversation is one of the important tasks in natural language processing. For conversation summarization tasks, corpora have an important role to analyze characteristics of conversations and to construct a method for summary generation. We are developing a freely available Japanese conversation corpus for a decision-making task. We call it the Kyutech corpus. The current version of the Kyutech corpus contains topic tags of each utterance and reference summaries of each conversation. In this paper, we explain an annotation task of extractive summaries. In the annotation task, we annotate an importance tag for each utterance and link utterances with sentences in reference summaries that already exist in the Kyutech corpus. By using the annotated extractive summaries, we can evaluate extractive summarization methods on the Kyutech corpus. In the experiment, we compare some methods based on machine learning techniques with some features.

T2  - ADVANCED CONCEPTS FOR INTELLIGENT VISION SYSTEMS, PROCEEDINGS
CP  - 7th International Conference on Advanced Concepts for Intelligent Vision Systems
AB  - We describe a method for removing quantization artifacts (de-quantizing) in the image domain, by enforcing a high degree of sparseness in its representation with an overcomplete oriented pyramid. For this purpose we devise a linear operator that returns the minimum L2-norm image preserving a set of significant coefficients, and estimate the original by minimizing the cardinality of that subset, always ensuring that the result is compatible with the quantized observation. We implement this solution by alternated projections onto convex sets, and test it through simulations with a set of standard images. Results are highly satisfactory in terms of performance, robustness and efficiency.

T2  - ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF NEURAL NETWORKS, EANN 2013, PT I
CP  - 14th International Conference on Engineering Applications of Neural Networks (EANN)
AB  - Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is a key process for various natural language processing related tasks, in which each word of a sentence is assigned a uniquely interpretable label (called a POS tag). There are many proposed methodologies for this task, such as Hidden Markov Models, Conditional Random Fields, Maximum Entropy classifiers etc. Such methods are primarily intended for English which, in comparison to highly inflectional languages has a relatively small tagset inventory. One of the well-known methods used for large tagset labeling (referred to as morpho-syntactic descriptors or MSDs) is called Tiered Tagging (Tufis, 1999), (Tufis and Dragomirescu, 2006) and it exploits a reduced set of tags from which context irrelevant features (e.g. gender information) which can be deduced trough the word form's flectional analysis are stripped. In our previous work we presented an alternative method to Tiered Tagging, in which we performed multi-class classification with a feed-forward neural network. Our methodology has the advantage that it does not require extensive linguistic knowledge as implied by the previously mentioned approach. We extend our work by testing our tool on Czech and successfully experimenting with a genetic algorithm designed to find a better network topology.

TI  - A cooperative approach to efficient global optimization
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION
AB  - The efficient global optimization (EGO) algorithm is widely used for solving expensive optimization problems, but it has been frequently criticized for its incapability of solving high-dimensional problems, i.e., problems with 100 or more variables. Extending the EGO algorithm to high dimensions encounters two major challenges: the training time of the Kriging model goes up rapidly and the difficulty of solving the infill optimization problem increases exponentially as the dimension of the problem increases. In this work, we propose a simple and efficient cooperative framework to tackle these two problems simultaneously. In the proposed framework, we first randomly decompose the original high-dimensional problem into several sub-problems, and then train the Kriging model and solve the infill optimization problem for each sub-problem. Context vectors are used to link the sub-problems such that the Kriging models are trained and the infill optimization problems are solved in a cooperative way. Once all the sub-problems have been solved, we start another random decomposition again and repeat the divide-and-conquer process until the computational budget is reached. Experiment results show that the proposed cooperative approach can bring nearly linear speedup with respect to the number of sub-problems. The proposed approach also shows competitive optimization performance when compared with the standard EGO and six high-dimensional versions of EGO. This work provides an efficient and effective approach for high-dimensional expensive optimization.

T2  - ADVANCES IN COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, PT I (IWANN 2015)
CP  - 13th International Work-Conference on Artificial Neural Networks (IWANN)
AB  - The interest in dealing with imbalanced datasets has grown in the last years, since they represent many real world scenarios. Different methods that address imbalance problems can be classified into three categories: data sampling, algorithmic modification and cost-sensitive learning. The fundamentals of the last methodology is to assign higher costs to wrong classification classes with the aim of reducing higher cost errors.
   In this paper, CO2RBFN-CS, a cooperative-competitive Radial Basis Function Network algorithm that implements cost-sensitivity is presented. Specifically, a cost parameter is introduced in the training stage of the algorithm. This parameter modifies the learning rate of the weights taking into account the right (or wrong) classification of the instance, the type of class (majority or minority) and the imbalance ratio of the data set.

TI  - Hybrid Approach for Language Identification Oriented to Multilingual Speech Recognition in the Basque Context
T2  - HYBRID ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS, PT 1
CP  - 5th International Conference on Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Systems
AB  - The development of Multilingual Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition systems involves issues as: Language Identification, Acoustic-Phonetic Decoding, Language Modelling or the development of appropriated Language Resources. The interest on Multilingual Systems arouses because there are three official languages in the Basque Country (Basque, Spanish, and French), and there is much linguistic interaction among them, even if Basque has very different roots than the other two languages. This paper describes the development of a Language Identification (LID) system oriented to robust Multilingual Speech Recognition for the Basque context. The work presents hybrid strategies for LID, based on the selection of system elements by Support Vector Machines and Multilayer Perceptron classifiers and stochastic methods for speech recognition tasks (Hidden Markov Models and n-grams).

TI  - Multi-camera BEV video-surveillance system for efficient monitoring of social distancing
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
AB  - The current sanitary emergency situation caused by COVID-19 has increased the interest in controlling the flow of people in indoor infrastructures, to ensure compliance with the established security measures. Top view camera-based solutions have proven to be an effective and non-invasive approach to accomplish this task. Nevertheless, current solutions suffer from scalability problems: they cover limited range areas to avoid dealing with occlusions and only work with single camera scenarios. To overcome these problems, we present an efficient and scalable people flow monitoring system that relies on three main pillars: an optimized top view human detection neural network based on YOLO-V4, capable of working with data from cameras at different heights; a multi-camera 3D detection projection and fusion procedure, which uses the camera calibration parameters for an accurate real-world positioning; and a tracking algorithm which jointly processes the 3D detections coming from all the cameras, allowing the traceability of individuals across the entire infrastructure. The conducted experiments show that the proposed system generates robust performance indicators and that it is suitable for real-time applications to control sanitary measures in large infrastructures. Furthermore, the proposed projection approach achieves an average positioning error below 0.2 meters, with an improvement of more than 4 times compared to other methods.

TI  - Image Segmentation Using Multilevel Thresholding and Genetic Algorithm: An Approach
T2  - 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA SCIENCE AND BUSINESS ANALYTICS (ICDSBA 2018)
CP  - 2nd International Conference on Data Science and Business Analytics (ICDSBA)
AB  - The segmentation aims the partitioning of a digital image into segments/objects in order to simplify its analyze. Its comprehensive application makes it an important section of computer vision studies where thresholding is one of the most important techniques. This paper proposes the application of a genetic algorithm associated with a thresholding method in a way that it makes more practical the location of optimal thresholds in view of the fact that the expansion in multiple thresholds of already consecrated methods to perform this processing might be too memory consuming and time exhaustive to the system. A comparison between values reached by the proposed method and Otsu's method are presented for one and two levels showing good results, in addition to the application and results in higher levels of the proposed algorithm which are visual satisfactory to distinguish the original objects by human vision with low range variations of the value.

T2  - MEDICAL IMAGE COMPUTING AND COMPUTER-ASSISTED INTERVENTION, MICCAI 2011, PT III
CP  - 14th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2011)
AB  - Automatic segmentation of spinal nerve bundles that originate within the dural sac and exit the spinal canal is important for diagnosis and surgical planning. The variability in intensity, contrast, shape and direction of nerves seen in high resolution myelographic MR images makes segmentation a challenging task. In this paper, we present an automatic tracking method for nerve segmentation based on particle filters. We develop a novel approach to particle representation and dynamics, based on Bezier splines. Moreover, we introduce a robust image likelihood model that enables delineation of nerve bundles and ganglia from the surrounding anatomical structures. We demonstrate accurate and fast nerve tracking and compare it to expert manual segmentation.

AB  - In many instances it is very desirable to store information in a data-base using natural language. As a matter of fact, linguistic variables are key issues in fuzzy data-bases. The complexity of the analysis in retrieving this kind of information may be reduced because, in general, a restricted subset (jargon) of the natural language is used to describe the contents of the data-base. The present paper presents a procedure to recover this jargon. Some examples about how to use this jargon to retrive information from the data-base are presented.

TI  - Memetic Algorithm with Local Search Chaining for Large Scale Continuous Optimization Problems
T2  - 2009 IEEE CONGRESS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION, VOLS 1-5
CP  - IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation
AB  - Memetic algorithms arise as very effective algorithms to obtain reliable and high accurate solutions for complex continuous optimization problems. Nowadays, high dimensional optimization problems are an interesting field of research. The high dimensionality introduces new problems for the optimization process, making recommendable to test the behavior of the optimization algorithms to large-scale problems. The Local search method must be applied with a higher intensity, specially to most promising solutions, to explore the higher domain space around each solution. In this work, we present a preliminar study of a memetic algorithm that assigns to each individual a local search intensity that depends on its features, by chaining different local search applications. This algorithm have obtained good results in continuous optimization and we study whether is a good algorithm for large scale optimizations problems.
   We make experiments of our proposal using the benchmark problems defined in the Special Session or Competition on Large Scale Global Optimisation, on the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation in 2008. First, we test different local search methods to identify the best one. Then, we compare the proposed algorithm with the algorithms used into the competition, obtaining that our proposal is a very promising algorithm for this type of high-dimensional problems: with dimension 500 our proposal is the second best of the compared algorithms, and the best memetic algorithm.

TI  - Efficient design optimisation for UAV-enabled mobile edge computing in cognitive radio networks
T2  - IET COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Mobile edge computing (MEC) has been envisaged as a promising technique in fifth generation (5G) and beyond wireless networks. In order to alleviate the explosive growth of computation and spectrum demand, cognitive radio (CR) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are studied in MEC-aware networks. In this study, considering a local computation and partial offloading scheme, a UAV-enabled CR-MEC framework is proposed and the authors' aim is to maximise the energy efficiency (EE) of the wireless devices (WDs). The formulated optimisation problem is not convex and challenging to be solved. To deal with it, an equivalent reformulation of this EE maximisation problem is introduced, and the authors decompose the original problem into two sub-problems, wherein the sub-problems become tractable and can be solved by jointly optimising sensing time, offloading power and WD-UAV scheduling. Numerical results highlight the EE enhancement with various system parameters and reveal the superiority of the proposed algorithm than other schemes with low computational complexity.

TI  - A blind convolutional deep autoencoder for spectral unmixing of hyperspectral images over waterbodies
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
AB  - Harmful algal blooms have dangerous repercussions for biodiversity, the ecosystem, and public health. Automatic identification based on remote sensing hyperspectral image analysis provides a valuable mechanism for extracting the spectral signatures of harmful algal blooms and their respective percentage in a region of interest. This paper proposes a new model called a non-symmetrical autoencoder for spectral unmixing to perform endmember extraction and fractional abundance estimation. The model is assessed in benchmark datasets, such as Jasper Ridge and Samson. Additionally, a case study of the HSI2 image acquired by NASA over Lake Erie in 2017 is conducted for extracting optical water types. The results using the proposed model for the benchmark datasets improve unmixing performance, as indicated by the spectral angle distance compared to five baseline algorithms. Improved results were obtained for various metrics. In the Samson dataset, the proposed model outperformed other methods for water (0.060) and soil (0.025) endmember extraction. Moreover, the proposed method exhibited superior performance in terms of mean spectral angle distance compared to the other five baseline algorithms. The non-symmetrical autoencoder for the spectral unmixing approach achieved better results for abundance map estimation, with a root mean square error of 0.091 for water and 0.187 for soil, compared to the ground truth. For the Jasper Ridge dataset, the non-symmetrical autoencoder for the spectral unmixing model excelled in the tree (0.039) and road (0.068) endmember extraction and also demonstrated improved results for water abundance maps (0.1121). The proposed model can identify the presence of chlorophyll-a in waterbodies. Chlorophyll-a is an essential indicator of the presence of the different concentrations of macrophytes and cyanobacteria. The non-symmetrical autoencoder for spectral unmixing achieves a value of 0.307 for the spectral angle distance metric compared to a reference ground truth spectral signature of chlorophyll-a. The source code for the proposed model, as implemented in this manuscript, can be found at https://github.com/EstefaniaAlfaro/autoencoder_owt_spectral.git.

CP  - 3rd Conference on Learning and Intelligent Optimization
AB  - Memetic algorithms arise as very effective algorithms to obtain reliable and high accurate solutions for complex continuous optimization problems. Nowadays, high-dimensional optimization problems are an interesting field of research. Its high dimension introduces new problems for the optimization process, making recommendable to test the behavior of optimization algorithms to large-scale problems. In memetic algorithms, the local search method is responsible of exploring the neighborhood of the current solutions; therefore, the dimensionality has a direct influence over this component. The aim of this paper is to study this influence. We design different memetic algorithms that only differ in the local search method applied, and they are compared using two sets of continuous benchmark functions: a standard one and a specific set with large-scale problems. The results show that high dimensionality reduces the differences among the different local search methods.

TI  - Exploring the characteristics of an optimal design of non-programming plugged learning for developing primary school students' computational thinking in mathematics
T2  - ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Existing computational thinking (CT) research focuses on programming in K-12 education; however, there are challenges in introducing it into the formal disciplines. Therefore, we propose the introduction of non-programming plugged learning in mathematics to develop students' CT. The research and teaching teams collaborated to develop an instructional design for primary school students. The participants were 112 third- and fourth-grade students (aged 9-10) who took part in three rounds of experiments. In this paper, we present an iterative problem-solving process in design-based implementation research, focusing on the implementation issues that lead to the design principles in the mathematics classroom. The computational tasks, environment, tools, and practices were iteratively improved over three rounds to incorporate CT effectively into mathematics. Results from the CT questionnaire demonstrated that the new program could significantly improve students' CT abilities and compound thinking. The results of the post-test revealed that CT, including the sub-dimensions of decomposition, algorithmic thinking, and problem-solving improved threefold compared to the pre-test between the three rounds, indicating that strengthened CT design enhanced CT perceptions. Similarly, the students' and teacher' interviews confirmed their positive experiences with CT. Based on empirical research, we summarize design characteristics from computational tasks, computational environment and tools, and computational practices and propose design principles. We demonstrate the potential of non-programming plugged learning for developing primary school students' CT in mathematics.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - In this paper we establish the attributable risk on respiratory and cardiovascular disorders related to traffic intensity in Madrid. In contrast to previous related studies, the proposed approach directly associates road traffic counts to patient emergency admission rates instead of using primary air pollutants. By applying Shapley values over gradient boosting machines, a first selection step is performed among all traffic observation points based on their influence on patient emergency admissions at Gregorio Maranon hospital. A subsequent quantification of the relative risk associated to traffic intensity of the selected point is calculated via ARIMA and log-linear Poisson regression models. The results obtained show that 13% of respiratory cases are related to traffic intensity while, in the case of cardiovascular disorders, the percentage increases to 39%.

TI  - Memetic algorithms based on local search chains for large scale continuous optimisation problems: MA-SSW-Chains
T2  - SOFT COMPUTING
AB  - Nowadays, large scale optimisation problems arise as a very interesting field of research, because they appear in many real-world problems (bio-computing, data mining, etc.). Thus, scalability becomes an essential requirement for modern optimisation algorithms. In a previous work, we presented memetic algorithms based on local search chains. Local search chain concerns the idea that, at one stage, the local search operator may continue the operation of a previous invocation, starting from the final configuration reached by this one. Using this technique, it was presented a memetic algorithm, MA-CMA-Chains, using the CMA-ES algorithm as its local search component. This proposal obtained very good results for continuous optimisation problems, in particular with medium-size (with up to dimension 50). Unfortunately, CMA-ES scalability is restricted by several costly operations, thus MA-CMA-Chains could not be successfully applied to large scale problems. In this article we study the scalability of memetic algorithms based on local search chains, creating memetic algorithms with different local search methods and comparing them, considering both the error values and the processing cost. We also propose a variation of Solis Wets method, that we call Subgrouping Solis Wets algorithm. This local search method explores, at each step of the algorithm, only a random subset of the variables. This subset changes after a certain number of evaluations. Finally, we propose a new memetic algorithm based on local search chains for high dimensionality, MA-SSW-Chains, using the Subgrouping Solis Wets' algorithm as its local search method. This algorithm is compared with MA-CMA-Chains and different reference algorithms, and it is shown that the proposal is fairly scalable and it is statistically very competitive for high-dimensional problems.

TI  - Low-cost wavefront coding using coma and a denoising-based deconvolution
T2  - ELECTRO-OPTICAL AND INFRARED SYSTEMS: TECHNOLOGY AND APPLICATIONS IV
CP  - Conference on Electro-Optical and Infrared Systems - Technology and Applications IV
AB  - Wavefront coding (WFC) is a powerful hybrid optical-numerical technique for increasing the depth of focus of imaging systems. It is based on two components: (1) an optical phase element that codifies the wavefront, and (2) a numerical deconvolution algorithm that reconstructs the image. Traditionally, some sophisticated optical WFC designs have been used to obtain approximate focus-invariant point spread functions (PSFs). Instead, we present a simple and low cost solution, implemented on infrared (IR) cameras, which uses a decentred lens inducing coma as an adjustable and removable phase element. We have used an advanced deconvolution algorithm for the image reconstruction, which is very robust against high noise levels. These features allow its application to low cost imaging systems. We show encouraging preliminary results based on realistic simulations using optical PSFs and noise power spectral density (PSD) laboratory models of two IR imaging systems. Without induced optical phase, the reconstruction algorithm improves the image quality in all cases, but it performs poorly when there are both in and out-of-focus objects in the scene. When using our coding/decoding scheme with low-noise detectors, the proposed solution provides high quality and robust recovery even for severe defocus. As sensor noise increases, the image suffers a graceful degradation, its quality being still acceptable even when using highly noisy sensors, such as microbolometers. We have experienced that the amount of induced coma is a key design parameter: while it only slightly affects the in-focus image quality, it is determinant for the final depth of focus.

TI  - Memetic Algorithm for Intense Local Search Methods Using Local Search Chains
T2  - HYBRID METAHEURISTICS, PROCEEDINGS
CP  - 5th International Workshop on Hybrid Metaheuristics
AB  - This contribution presents a new memetic algorithm for continuous optimization problems, which is specially designed for applying intense local search methods. These local search methods make use of explicit strategy parameters to guide the search, and adapt these parameters with the purpose of producing more effective solutions. They may achieve accurate results, at the cost of requiring high intensity, making more difficult their application into a memetic algorithm. Our memetic algorithm approach assigns to each individual a local search intensity that depends on its features, by chaining different local search applications. With this technique of search chains, at each stage the local search operator may continue the operation of a previous invocation, starting from the final configuration reached by this one. The proposed memetic algorithm integrates the CMA-ES algorithm as their local search operator. We compare our proposal with other memetic algorithms and evolutionary algorithms for continuous optimization, showing that it presents a clear superiority over the compared algorithms.

TI  - Size-dependent mechanics of viscoelastic carbon nanotubes: Modeling, theoretical and numerical analysis
T2  - RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB  - This research presents the complex mechanics of the size-dependent viscoelastic carbon nanotube (CNT) subjected to the electric load. The mechanical model describing the motions of CNT is formulated by the Euler beam theory, Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic model, and nonlocal continuum theory. The nonlinear governing equation and end conditions are deduced by the generalized Hamilton principle. The homoclinic structure of the CNT system is constructed using the reductive perturbation approach and the infinite-dimensional global perturbation method. Finally, using the extensive parametric analysis, the impact of electric excitation, nano-scale effect, and viscoelastic effect on the complex mechanics of CNT is simultaneously highlighted. Additionally, the comparison is also conducted with published researches to test the model and theoretical analysis.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to start an investigation and a comparison of the expressiveness of the two most relevant formalisms inspired by membranes interactions, namely, P systems and Brane Calculi. We compare the two formalisms with respect to their ability to act as generator devices. In particular, we show different ways of generating the set L = {n(2) vertical bar n > 1} in P systems and in Brane Calculi.

TI  - BAYESIAN COMPRESSIVE SENSING OF WAVELET COEFFICIENTS USING MULTISCALE LAPLACIAN PRIORS
T2  - 2009 IEEE/SP 15TH WORKSHOP ON STATISTICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING, VOLS 1 AND 2
CP  - 15th IEEE/SP Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing
AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for image reconstruction from compressive measurements of wavelet coefficients. By incorporating independent Laplace priors on separate wavelet sub-bands, the inhomogeneity of wavelet coefficient distributions and therefore the structural sparsity within images are modeled effectively. We model the problem by adopting a Bayesian formulation, and develop a fast greedy reconstruction algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the reconstruction performance of the proposed algorithm is competitive with state-of-the-art methods while outperforming them in terms of running times.

TI  - Verification of validity of syllogisms with intermediate quantifiers is equivalent with checking Peterson's rules
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING
AB  - This paper is a continuation of the previous work in which we analyzed six Peterson's rules for checking the validity of Aristotle's classical syllogisms and also their extension for checking the validity of syllogisms with intermediate quantifiers. We formalized the rules and proved that only four rules are sufficient. We also proved that if a syllogism is valid, then it satisfies all four (and consequently all six) rules. In this paper, we return to this topic and prove much stronger result, namely that a syllogism with intermediate quantifiers is valid if and only if it satisfies all four (and consequently all six) extended Peterson's rules.

TI  - Teammate Familiarity in Distributed Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning: The Mediating Role of Social Presence
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF RESEARCH IN OPEN AND DISTRIBUTED LEARNING
AB  - Owing to the limitations of computer-mediated communication (CMC), distributed CSCL (Computersupported collaborative learning) has not always been as effective as desired. Despite recognizing the significance of group composition, the exploration of the function of teammate familiarity in distributed educational settings is restricted. This study explored the influence of teammate familiarity and social presence in a distributed CSCL setting by conducting an online survey of 288 Korean university students with experience in distributed CSCL. The results indicate that teammate familiarity increased the social presence experienced by students among their peers. Social presence subsequently enhanced teamwork satisfaction and, ultimately, increased self-assessed knowledge gain. More importantly, the relationship between teammate familiarity and teamwork satisfaction was mediated by social presence. Social media platforms and class webpages were the most widely used channels for students to get to know their teammates. Our study provided insights for improving the effectiveness of distributed CSCL and a framework for investigating social presence in satisfaction building in various contexts, including online education.

TI  - Characterizing the stabilization effects of stabilizers in protein-protein systems with end-point binding free energy calculations
T2  - BRIEFINGS IN BIOINFORMATICS
AB  - Drug design targeting protein-protein interactions (PPIs) associated with the development of diseases has been one of the most important therapeutic strategies. Besides interrupting the PPIs with PPI inhibitors/blockers, increasing evidence shows that stabilizing the interaction between two interacting proteins may also benefit the therapy, such as the development of various types of molecular glues/stabilizers that mostly work by stabilizing the two interacting proteins to regulate the downstream biological effects. However, characterizing the stabilization effect of a stabilizer is usually hard or too complicated for traditional experiments since it involves ternary interactions [protein-protein-stabilizer (PPS) interaction]. Thus, developing reliable computational strategies will facilitate the discovery/design of molecular glues or PPI stabilizers. Here, by fully analyzing the energetic features of the binary interactions in the PPS ternary complex, we systematically investigated the performance of molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) and molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) methods on characterizing the stabilization effects of stabilizers in 14-3-3 systems. The results show that both MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA are powerful tools in distinguishing the stabilizers from the decoys (with area under the curves of 0.90-0.93 for all tested cases) and are reasonable for ranking protein-peptide interactions in the presence or absence of stabilizers as well (with the average Pearson correlation coefficient of similar to 0.6 at a relatively high dielectric constant for both methods). Moreover, to give a detailed picture of the stabilization effects, the stabilization mechanism is also analyzed from the structural and energetic points of view for individual systems containing strong or weak stabilizers. This study demonstrates a potential strategy to accelerate the discovery of PPI stabilizers.

TI  - Scalability Model Based on the Concept of Granularity
T2  - PARALLEL PROCESSING AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS, PPAM 2015, PT II
CP  - 11th International Conference on Parallel Processing and Applied Mathematics (PPAM)
AB  - In the recent years it can be observed increasing popularity of parallel processing using multi-core processors, local clusters, GPU and others. Moreover, currently one of the main requirements the IT users is the reduction of maintaining cost of the computer infrastructure. It causes that the performance evaluation of the parallel applications becomes one of the most important problem. Then obtained results allows efficient use of available resources. In traditional methods of performance evaluation the results are based on wall-clock time measurements. This approach requires consecutive application executions and includes a time-consuming data analysis. In the paper an alternative approach is proposed. The decomposition of parallel application execution time onto computation time and overheads related to parallel execution is use to calculate the granularity of application and then determine its efficiency. Finally the application scalability can be evaluates.

TI  - A prospective observational study of optimal acupoint selection on patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders
T2  - MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction:Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), which include irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional dyspepsia (FD), are common gastrointestinal (GI) diseases that have a large financial impact on patients' quality of life (QoL). Traditional Korean medicine has a particular diagnostic pattern for treating FGIDs. However, FGIDs have not been thoroughly explored because of their complexity. In this proposed study, we will investigate the acupoint selection pattern for FGID patients with various disease patterns, and further determine the best acupoints for treating FGID patients using a machine-learning algorithm. Methods:We will collect clinical data from 15 multi-center Korean medical clinics that treat FGID as part of an observational study registry. Patients who meet the criteria will be added to the registry after screening. They will receive a maximum 4-week treatment, and they will respond 3 times to a series of questions. We will investigate how doctors of FGID patients with diverse disease patterns choose the acupoints, and we will use a machine learning technique to identify the best acupoints for treating FGID patients. Discussion:This will be the first multi-center observational registry study to assess how traditional Korean medical practitioners diagnose and treat patients in the real world. The findings will shed light on how traditional Korean medicine treats FGIDs and demonstrate the rationale for the diagnostic and acupuncture treatment flow.

TI  - Efficient anomaly detection from medical signals and images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPEECH TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Anomaly detection is a very vital area in medical signal and image processing due to its importance in automatic diagnosis. This paper presents three efficient anomaly detection approaches for applications related to Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal processing and retinal image processing. The first approach depends on the utilization of Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for automatic seizure detection. The second one is based on the utilization of digital filters in a statistical framework for seizure prediction. Finally, an automated Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) diagnosis approach is presented based on the segmentation and detection of anomalous objects from retinal images. The presented simulation results reveal the success of the proposed techniques towards automated medical diagnosis.

TI  - Implementation of Massive Parallel Networks of Evolutionary Processors (MPNEP): 3-Colorability Problem
T2  - NATURE INSPIRED COOPERATIVE STRATEGIES FOR OPTIMIZATION (NICSO 2007)
CP  - International Workshop on Nature Inspired Cooperative Strategies for Optimization
AB  - This paper presents a new dynamic in Networks of Evolutionary Processors (NEP) - Massive Parallel NEP. Processors in a MPNEP have not a two stage behavior: evolution and then, communication; both steps are in parallel. Such situation give processors the benefit of communicating objects without rule application. MPNEP could be considered a superset of NEP since processors in MPNEP are able to operate in a parallel way or in a sequential way. Here we proposed a mechanism to obtain an MPNEP equivalent to any given NEP. Therefore, MPNEP can solve NP-problems in linear time such as NEPs. This paper proof that a MPNEP solve the 3-colorability problem in O(m + n) time and resources. A software tool has been implemented in order to test MPNEP performance and some outputs, corresponding to the 3-col problem, are shown.

TI  - Using rooftop photovoltaic generation to cover individual electric vehicle demand-A detailed case study
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB  - The introduction of battery electric vehicles (BEV) and the expansion of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) power generation are both progressing at a fast pace to decarbonize the transport and the energy sector in Switzerland. These parallel developments have an enormous synergy potential as the actual decarbonization impact of BEVs depends heavily on the carbon footprint of the power source and the PV expansion requires local storage as a buffer to reduce negative impacts on the distribution grid. We present an empirical analysis based on a detailed 10-month data set of the charging and mobility behavior of 78 BEV users in Switzerland. It is combined with a fine-grained digital surface model of Switzerland to extract the detailed roof geometry and the corresponding rooftop PV generation capacity of each of the BEV owner's houses.We test four different smart charging strategies with a varying degree of complexity and find that when charging uncontrolled (the strategy used during the study), BEV owners can only cover 15 % of their BEV's demand using PV generated from the roofs of their own houses. A simple controlled charging approach greatly increases the average coverage to 56 % and up to 90 % or 99 % when using an optimized charging strategy without or with a home battery storage. All charging strategies ensure that the individual mobility behavior of the BEV owners is not affected.We further show that using rooftop PV power generation for BEV charging has a large potential to further decrease the climate impact of BEVs and propose simple adjustments to consider in charging strategies that help to increase the owners' PV consumption.

TI  - Presentation of entropy due to heat transfer irreversibility of MHD Williamson fluid over an inclined channel
T2  - MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB  - The non-Newtonian characteristic of the fluid flow phenomena has several applications in industries and the production of engineering gadgets. Based upon the role, the present work deals with the flow of Williamson nanofluid past two inclined parallel sheets. Further, the influence of radiating heat due to thermal radiation, Ohmic heating because of the magnetization, and inclined angle on Williamson fluid are presented, which are vital for the heat transfer enhancement. The proposed study became novel due to the scrutiny of entropy for the irreversibility processes within the system that is obtained due to heat transfer. The designed model with dimensional form is developed by converting to dimensionless forms with the help of similarity transformations. The finalized transformed equations are handled analytically using the Homotopy perturbation method (HPM). Heat irreversibility is calculated by inserting the observed values into entropy generation and Bejan number. The suggested method of solution for the momentum profile is verified by comparing it to a previously published numerical result in some limited circumstances, and great agreement is found. The result reveals that the entropy generation is enhanced near the upper wall of the channel for the magnetized particle but thermal radiation attenuates it, however, the fluid temperature boosts up for the enhanced coupling constraint i.e. for the existence of Eckert number.

TI  - Pythagorean-Hodograph curves-based trajectory planning for pick-and-place operation of Delta robot with prescribed pick and place heights
T2  - ROBOTICA
AB  - In this paper, a Pythagorean-Hodograph (PH) curve-based pick-and-place operation trajectory planning method for Delta parallel robots is proposed, which realizes the flexible control of pick-and-place operations to meet the requirements of various practical scenarios. First, according to the geometric relationship of pick-and-place operation path, different pick-and-place operations are classified. Then trajectory planning is carried out for different situations, respectively, and in each case, the different polynomial motion laws adopted by the linear motion segment and the curved motion segment are solved. Trajectory optimization is performed with the motion period as optimization objective. The proposed method is easier to implement, and at the same time satisfies the safety, optimization, mobility, and stability of the robot; that is, the proposed method realizes obstacle avoidance, optimal time, flexible control of the robot trajectory, and stable motion. Simulations and experiments verify the effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper. The proposed method can not only realize the fast, accurate, and safe operation in intelligent manufacturing fields such as rapid classification, palletizing, grasping, warehousing, etc., but its research route can also provide a reference for trajectory planning of intelligent vehicles in logistics system.

CP  - 20th Latin American Robotics Symposium (LARS) / 15th Brazilian Symposium on Robotics (SBR) / 14th Workshop on Robotics in Education (WRE)
AB  - This work presents a study on parallel and distributional deep reinforcement learning applied to the mapless navigation of UAVs. For this, we developed an approach based on the Soft Actor-Critic method, producing a distributed and distributional variant named PDSAC, and compared it with a second one based on the traditional SAC algorithm. In addition, we also embodied a prioritized memory system into them. The UAV used in the study is based on the Hydrone vehicle, a hybrid quadrotor operating solely in the air. The inputs for the system are 23 range findings from a Lidar sensor and the distance and angles towards a desired goal, while the outputs consist of the linear, angular, and, altitude velocities. The methods were trained in environments of varying complexity, from obstacle-free environments to environments with multiple obstacles in three dimensions. The results obtained, demonstrate a concise improvement in the navigation capabilities by the proposed approach when compared to the agent based on the SAC for the same amount of training steps. In summary, this work presented a study on deep reinforcement learning applied to mapless navigation of drones in three dimensions, with promising results and potential applications in various contexts related to robotics and autonomous air navigation with distributed and distributional variants.

TI  - Learning structural bioinformatics and evolution with a snake puzzle
T2  - PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB  - We propose here a working unit for teaching basic concepts of structural bioinformatics and evolution through the example of a wooden snake puzzle, strikingly similar to toy models widely used in the literature of protein folding. In our experience, developed at a Master's course at the Universidad Auto noma de Madrid (Spain), the concreteness of this example helps to overcome difficulties caused by the interdisciplinary nature of this field and its high level of abstraction, in particular for students coming from traditional disciplines. The puzzle will allow us discussing a simple algorithm for finding folded solutions, through which we will introduce the concept of the configuration space and the contact matrix representation. This is a central tool for comparing protein structures, for studying simple models of protein energetics, and even for a qualitative discussion of folding kinetics, through the concept of the Contact Order. It also allows a simple representation of misfolded conformations and their free energy. These concepts will motivate evolutionary questions, which we will address by simulating a structurally constrained model of protein evolution, again modelled on the snake puzzle. In this way, we can discuss the analogy between evolutionary concepts and statistical mechanics that facilitates the understanding of both concepts. The proposed examples and literature are accessible, and we provide supplementary material (see 'Data Availability') to reproduce the numerical experiments. We also suggest possible directions to expand the unit. We hope that this work will further stimulate the adoption of games in teaching practice.

TI  - An efficient method for image forgery detection based on trigonometric transforms and deep learning
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
AB  - Image forgery detection is the basic key to solve many problems, especially social problems such as those in Facebook, and court cases. The common form of image forgery is the copy-move forgery, in which a section of the image is copied and pasted in another location within the same image. In this type of image forgery, it is easy to perform forgery, but more difficult to detect it, because the features of the copied parts are similar to those of the other parts of the image. This paper presents an approach for copy-move forgery detection based on block processing and feature extraction from the transforms of the blocks. In addition, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used for forgery detection. The feature extraction is implemented with serial pairs of convolution and pooling layers, and then classification between the original and tampered images is performed with and without transforms. A comparison study between different trigonometric transforms in 1D and 2D is presented for detecting the tampered parts in the image. This comparison study is based on the completeness rate for the detection. This comparison ensures that the DFT in 1D or 2D implementations is the best choice to detect copy-move forgery compared to other trigonometric transforms. In addition, the paper presents a comparison study between ten cases using the CNN learning technique to detect the manipulated image. The basic idea is to use a CNN to detect and extract features. The proposed CNN approach can also be used for active forgery detection because of its robustness to detect the manipulation of digital watermarked images or images with signatures.

TI  - Early classification of time series using multi-objective optimization techniques
T2  - INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB  - In early classification of time series the objective is to build models which are able to make class-predictions for time series as accurately and as early as possible, when only a part of the series is available. It is logical to think that accuracy and earliness are conflicting objectives, since the more we wait, more data points from the series are available, and it is easier to make accurate class-predictions. Considering this, the problem can be very naturally formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, and solved as such. However, the solutions proposed in the literature up to now, reduce the problem into a single-objective problem by combining both objectives somehow. In this paper, we present a novel multi-objective formulation of the problem of early classification, and we design a solution using multi-objective optimization techniques. This method will provide a variety of solutions which find different trade-offs between both objectives, allowing the user to select the most suitable solution a-posteriori, depending on the accuracy and earliness requirements of the problem at hand. To prove the usefulness of our proposal, we carry out an extensive experimentation process using 45 benchmark databases and we present a case study in the financial domain. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Early Classification of Time Series by Simultaneously Optimizing the Accuracy and Earliness
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
AB  - The problem of early classification of time series appears naturally in contexts where the data, of temporal nature, are collected over time, and early class predictions are interesting or even required. The objective is to classify the incoming sequence as soon as possible, while maintaining suitable levels of accuracy in the predictions. Thus, we can say that the problem of early classification consists of optimizing two objectives simultaneously: accuracy and earliness. In this context, we present a method for early classification based on combining a set of probabilistic classifiers together with a stopping rule (SR). This SR will act as a trigger and will tell us when to output a prediction or when to wait for more data, and its main novelty lies in the fact that it is built by explicitly optimizing a cost function based on accuracy and earliness. We have selected a large set of benchmark data sets and four other state-of-the-art early classification methods, and we have evaluated and compared our framework obtaining superior results in terms of both earliness and accuracy.

TI  - Audio-visual combination of syllables involves time-sensitive dynamics following from fusion failure
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - In face-to-face communication, audio-visual (AV) stimuli can be fused, combined or perceived as mismatching. While the left superior temporal sulcus (STS) is presumably the locus of AV integration, the process leading to combination is unknown. Based on previous modelling work, we hypothesize that combination results from a complex dynamic originating in a failure to integrate AV inputs, followed by a reconstruction of the most plausible AV sequence. In two different behavioural tasks and one MEG experiment, we observed that combination is more time demanding than fusion. Using time-/source-resolved human MEG analyses with linear and dynamic causal models, we show that both fusion and combination involve early detection of AV incongruence in the STS, whereas combination is further associated with enhanced activity of AV asynchrony-sensitive regions (auditory and inferior frontal cortices). Based on neural signal decoding, we finally show that only combination can be decoded from the IFG activity and that combination is decoded later than fusion in the STS. These results indicate that the AV speech integration outcome primarily depends on whether the STS converges or not onto an existing multimodal syllable representation, and that combination results from subsequent temporal processing, presumably the off-line re-ordering of incongruent AV stimuli.

TI  - A novel deep learning framework for copy-moveforgery detection in images
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
AB  - In this era of technology, digital images turn out to be ubiquitous in a contemporary society and they can be generated and manipulated by a wide variety of hardware and software technologies. Copy-move forgery is considered as an image tampering technique that aims to generate manipulated tampered images by concealing unwanted objects or reproducing desirable objects within the same image. Therefore, image content authentication has become an essential demand. In this paper, an innovative design for automatic detection of copy-move forgery based on deep learning approaches is proposed. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is specifically designed for Copy-Move Forgery Detection (CMFD). The CNN is exploited to learn hierarchical feature representations from input images, which are used for detecting the tampered and original images. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed deep CMFD algorithm outperforms the traditional CMFD systems by a considerable margin on the three publicly accessible datasets: MICC-F220, MICC-F2000, and MICC-F600. Furthermore, the three datasets are incorporated and joined to the SATs-130 dataset to form new combinations of datasets. An accuracy of 100% has been achieved for the four datasets. This proves the robustness of the proposed algorithm against a diversity of known attacks. For better evaluation, comparative results are included.
