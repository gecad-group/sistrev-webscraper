This is the repo for my PESTI Project: Development of a web scraper for bibliographic reviews
This project consists of a Python Notebook that assists an investigator in the process of systematic reviews

### Dependencies
 - jupyter
 - numpy
 - pandas
 - matplotlib
 - rispy
 - asreview

_**NOTE**: I will not provide a guide on how to install these (for now)_

### How do I run this?

As stated previously, the main entrypoint is a Python Notebook ([sistrev.ipynb](sistrev.ipynb)).
You will need a Jupyter environment setup to run the Notebook
