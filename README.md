# SISTREV WebScraper

This is the repo for my PESTI Project: _Development of a web scraper for bibliographic reviews_.

This project consists of a Python Notebook that assists an investigator in the process of systematic reviews.

### Dependencies
All dependencies are on requirements.txt.

You can install them with:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

### How do I run this?

As stated previously, the main entrypoint is a Python Notebook ([sistrev.ipynb](sistrev.ipynb)).
You will need a Jupyter environment setup to run the Notebook.
